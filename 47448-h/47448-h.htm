<h2>PREFATORY NOTE</h2>


<p>The writings of William Harvey, as published by him,
and the letters published as part of his works, are all in
Latin. The passages from Harvey's works which appear
in English in the present paper are in part translations by
the late Dr. Willis, with changes, sometimes considerable,
by the present writer. In large part, however, the translations
from Harvey are not even based upon Dr. Willis's
work, but have been made by the present writer directly
from the original Latin. Naturally he assumes responsibility
for whatever he prints in English to represent
Harvey's words; and to attempt, in print, a more minute
discrimination between his own work as a translator and
that of Dr. Willis would be tedious and unprofitable.
Whoever may wish to make such discrimination may
readily do so, however, as, in the present paper, a reference
is made by page and line in the case of each translated
passage, not only to the Latin text of Harvey's
<cite>Opera Omnia</cite>, published by the Royal College of Physicians
of London in 1766, but also to Willis's English
translation thereof, published by the Sydenham Society
in 1847, and entitled "The Works of William Harvey,
M.D." Such references to the Sydenham Society's edition
are indispensable for another purpose, viz.: in order
that to each translated passage from Harvey in the present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
paper a context in English may readily be given by the
reader.</p>

<p>It has seemed best that the various references to Harvey's
Latin text should be made to that of the easily
accessible <cite>Opera Omnia</cite> rather than to that of the rarer
first editions of the several treatises. In the case of the
passages quoted from the treatise <cite>De Motu Cordis et Sanguinis
in Animalibus</cite> and from the treatise <cite>De Generatione
Animalium</cite>, the Latin of the <cite>Opera Omnia</cite> has been collated
by the present writer with that of the first editions.
The first editions of the Exercises to Riolanus and of the
various letters have not been accessible to him.</p>

<p>Much use has here been made of Harvey's private
lecture notes, first published in 1886 by the Royal College
of Physicians of London.</p>

<p>All the passages (except those from the Scriptures)
quoted in the present paper from writers other than
Harvey have been translated into English by the present
writer directly from the original Greek text or the original
Latin text, as the case may be.</p>

<h2>EDITORIAL NOTE</h2>


<p>Professor Curtis, to whom I am indebted for much
kindly help extended during a warm friendship of nearly
thirty years, died September 20, 1913. One of his final
requests was that his younger colleague arrange for the
publication of the present paper, upon which its writer
had been engaged for a period of several years and which
happily was practically completed. This request, coming
to me after the death of my friend, could be considered
only as a command. It has, therefore, fallen to me to
make a careful study of his text, to fill in with my own
words occasional slight gaps, to make occasional verbal
changes, to certify to the correctness of his numerous
references, and to make the manuscript, written and in
places rewritten many times with his own hand, ready for
the press. This I have done with affection for his memory
and with appreciation of his scholarly attainments.
Dr. Curtis's work represents a more profound study of
Harvey's ideas and comparison of them with those of the
most important of Harvey's predecessors than has heretofore
appeared. It is the work of one who from the background
of the physiological science of to-day delighted in
mastering the ideas of the fathers of modern physiology.
If his work is to be summarized in a single sentence, it
may be said that he has shown Harvey to be a disciple
more of Aristotle than of Galen. Although Harvey had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
the courage and the originality to break away from him
whose ideas had prevailed for fourteen centuries, and to
find the truth in regard to the movement of the blood,
he found much to approve in the master who had lived
five hundred years before Galen. Harvey's true position
in the world of physiological thought has not before
been made known. Herein lies Professor Curtis's contribution
to the history of his science.</p>

<h2>HARVEY'S VIEWS ON THE USE
OF THE CIRCULATION
OF THE BLOOD</h2>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3>HARVEY'S ATTITUDE TOWARD THE QUESTION OF THE
USE OF THE CIRCULATION</h3>


<p>It is a happy moment for a physiologist when the
train which is bearing him across the luxuriant plain
of Venetia stops at the cry of "Padova!" If he have not
informed himself too thoroughly about the sights which
he will see at the Paduan University, he will enjoy his
own surprise when he is ushered into the Anatomical
Theater of Fabricius ab Aquapendente&mdash;a room in
which standing-places rise steeply, tier above tier,
entirely around a small central oval pit. Looking
down into this, as he leans upon the rail, the traveler
will realize with sudden pleasure that William Harvey,
when a medical student, may often have leaned upon
the self-same rail to see Fabricius demonstrate the
anatomy of man. The place looks fit to have been a
nursery of object-teachers, for it is too small to hold a
pompous <em>cathedra</em>; and the veteran to whose Latin the
young Englishman listened must have stood directly
beside the dead body. To an American, musing there
alone, the closing years of the sixteenth century, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
last years of Queen Elizabeth of England, which seem
so remote to him when at home, are but as yesterday.</p>

<p>Recent, indeed, in the history of medicine is the year
1602, when Harvey received his doctor's degree at
Padua and returned to London; but for all that we
are right in feeling that our day is far removed from
his. The tireless progress of modern times has swept
on at the charging pace; but in Harvey's time books
were still a living force which had been written in days
five and six times as far removed from the student
of Padua as he from us. Galen, the Greek who practised
medicine at imperial Rome in the second century
of the Christian era; Aristotle, who had been the
tutor of Alexander the Great five hundred years before
Galen, when Rome was but a petty state warring with
her Italian neighbors;&mdash;these ancients were still great
working authorities in Harvey's day.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>It is against this persistent glow of the Greek thought
that Harvey stands out so vividly as the first great
modern figure in physiology. But it rather heightens
than lowers his achievement that it was by the ancient
glow that he saw his way forward, admiring the past,
but not dazzled by it. In his old age he bade a young
student "goe to the fountain head and read Aristotle,
Cicero, Avicenna"; and in talk with the same youth
Harvey called the moderns by a name so roughly contemptuous
that it will not bear repeating.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Yet in his
old age, in the very act of extolling the ancients, he
wrote as follows:<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"But while we acquiesce in their discoveries, and believe, such
is our sloth, that nothing further can be found out, the lively acuteness
of our genius languishes and we put out the torch which they
have handed on to us."</p></blockquote>

<div class="caption"><p>The Anatomical Theatre at Padua, where William Harvey listened to the

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>It was in 1628, the year of his fiftieth birthday, that
Harvey published, at Frankfort-on-the-Main, his famous
Latin treatise entitled: "An Anatomical Exercise
on the Motion of the Heart and Blood in Animals."
A reader of to-day will be inclined to skim rapidly over
the Introduction to this treatise and over much in the
last three chapters; and probably he will take only a
languid interest in the two brief Latin treatises which
Harvey published in defense of the circulation, after
more than twenty years of silence, in his seventy-first
year, at Cambridge in 1649; these treatises being entitled:
"Two Anatomical Exercises on the Circulation
of the Blood, to Johannes Riolanus, Junior, of Paris."</p>

<p>The demonstration of the circulation in the treatise
of 1628 is so irresistible that the ancient strongholds
of belief crash to the ground at that summons like the
walls of Jericho, and it seems a waste of time to scan
the fragments. But for all that, the edifice which had
stood for more than thirteen centuries was a goodly
structure; and whoever shall have read Aristotle and
Galen at first hand and shall then return to Harvey, will
read with interest what the same reader treated as a
mere foil for the great demonstration; and will realize
that the irresistible quality of the latter is shared by
Galen's demonstration that blood is naturally contained
in the arteries.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Moreover, it will be seen that if the
Greek of the second century could, like Harvey, appeal
to observation and experiment, the English physician
of the Renaissance, the student of Cambridge and
Padua, was an apt pupil of the Greeks. Harvey could,
and frequently and naturally did, view things from a
Greek and ancient standpoint when proof of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
nature was unattainable. This is to be seen not only in
his earlier and later exercises on the circulation, but also
in his last work, his "Exercise on the Generation of
Animals" with appended essays, published in Latin at
London in 1652, in Harvey's seventy-third year, two
years after the appearance of the exercises addressed
to Riolanus. This treatise On Generation deals also at
various points with the blood and the circulation, as do
in addition Harvey's published Latin letters. We shall
find, too, the same leaning upon the ancients as immediate
precursors in thinking, if we turn back from
the publications of Harvey's old age to the very first
written words of his which we possess, private lecture
notes jotted down by him in his thirty-seventh year
for use in 1616&mdash;notes happily printed and published
in 1886.<a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>  In these notes, written more than
eleven years before the publication of his most famous
treatise, he sets forth for the first time, though briefly,
the circulation of the blood, that physiological truth
which to my mind is completely and indisputably
Harvey's own discovery. It is with Harvey as the
interpreter, not the maker, of this discovery, that I
shall venture to deal in this paper.</p>

<p>In his old age the great discoverer recorded his own
attitude, as an interpreter, in the following words:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"That freedom which I freely concede to others, I demand with
good right for myself also; liberty, that is, in dealing with obscure
matters, to bring forward, to represent, the truth, that which seems
probable, until the falsity thereof shall clearly be established."<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="noind">In 1636, eight years after he had published the treatise
which now seems so convincing, Harvey was in Nuremberg<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
and wrote to Caspar Hofmann, M.D., a professor
of repute who lived there, offering to demonstrate the
circulation to him. In his letter Harvey quotes impatient
words of his German colleague, which show
that in the face of proof the circulation still seemed to
some men of high standing too useless to be true.
Harvey says to Hofmann:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"You have been pleased to reproach me rhetorically and chastise
me tacitly as one who seems to you 'to accuse and condemn
nature of folly as well as error, and to impose the character of a
most stupid and lazy craftsman on her, since he would permit the
blood to relapse into rawness and to return repeatedly to the
heart to be concocted again; and, as often, to the body at large
to become raw again; and would permit nature to ruin the made
and perfected blood in order that she may have something to do.'"<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="noind">To this attack Harvey calmly rejoins as follows, speaking
of the blood:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"As to its concoction and the causes of this its motion and circulation,
especially their final cause, I have said nothing, indeed
have put the subject by entirely and deliberately; as you will
find set down in plain words and otherwise if you will be pleased
to read again chapters VIII and IX."<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="noind">More than twelve years later still, in defending the
circulation against Riolanus, Harvey finds it necessary
to say:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Those who repudiate the circulation because they see neither
the efficient nor the final cause of it, and who exclaim '<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cui bono?</i>'&mdash;(As
to which I have brought forward nothing so far; it remains
to be shown)&mdash;plainly ought to inquire as to its existence before
inquiring why it exists; for from the facts which meet us in the
circulation regarded as existing, its uses and objects are to be
sought."<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p class="noind">In spite, however, of these disclaimers of formal position
Harvey had repeatedly intimated, by the way, what
was crossing his mind as to the meaning of the circulation,
to set forth the proofs of which had been his main
concern. Even in the eighth chapter to which Harvey
appealed in support of his disclaimer Hofmann could
have pointed to two passages as affording from his
standpoint a basis for his attack. In the second and
shorter of these two passages Harvey says of a vein as
compared with an artery:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"This is a way from the heart, that to the heart; that contains
cruder blood, effete and rendered unfit for nutrition; this, concocted,
perfect, alimentary blood."<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Harvey, indeed, as we shall find abundant evidence,
was both an observer and a speculator. In the latter
rôle he was not far removed from his physiological
predecessors of two thousand years; as an observer it
was his great merit to lead the physiologists of his time
and to point out to those of all later centuries the path
which they must follow.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>THE CIRCULATION AND THE FEEDING OF THE TISSUES</h3>


<p>That Harvey frequently took refuge in speculation
need excite no surprise. In the seventeenth century,
even with his extraordinary contributions of observed
fact to the knowledge of the circulation of the blood, the
paucity of physiological knowledge in general and of
experimental methods was so great that at every turn a
thinking man was tempted to fill in the gaps with that
which was beyond his powers of ocular demonstration.
Contemplation of the circulation, indeed, led Harvey
into contemplation of widely diverse problems of the
life process. The feeding of the tissues, the significance
of respiration, the cause of the heart-beat, the relative
importance of the heart and the blood in the bodily
hierarchy, the bodily heat and its source, and the seat
of the soul&mdash;to these and other topics he gave much
attention, and these we must consider. Let us begin
with the circulation and its relation to the feeding of the
tissues.</p>

<p>In the chapter of Harvey's book which follows at
once upon the brief qualitative statement quoted at
the end of our last chapter, Harvey himself brings us
face to face with the difficult quantitative question
raised by his triumphant proof of the circulation. He
says:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The blood under the influence of the arterial pulse enters and
is impelled in a continuous, equable, and incessant stream into
every part and member of the body, in much larger quantity than
were sufficient for nutrition or than the whole mass of fluids could
supply."<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="noind">Here we see that the rapid renewal of the blood in
"every part and member of the body" presented itself
to Harvey's own mind as calling for some other explanation
than the simple feeding of the tissues. The
question of "<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cui bono</i>" which his discovery raised is
still but incompletely answered; in Harvey's day it was
almost unanswerable. In dealing from time to time
with its main features he himself, as we shall see, could
only bring forward inadequate observations and shift
his ground from one erroneous doctrine to another. In
justice to his opponents, who seem to us so unreasonable,
let us remember how prodigious this new question of
"<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cui bono</i>" must have seemed when the circulation
itself was a novelty. Let us remember also that for
nearly two thousand years the tissues had been held to
feed themselves tranquilly out of the contents of the
vessels in a way fitly expressed by the old simile of
irrigation ditches in a garden&mdash;a simile which Aristotle
and Galen had borrowed in turn from Plato.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>But if Harvey saw only too well that the feeding of
the tissues could not explain the circulation, he had at
least seen plainly how the doctrine of the circulation
clarified the ancient but current doctrine as to the
absorption of the digested food. The portal vein had
been accepted as the route of this absorption. No
doubt both Aristotle and Galen had seen its ruddy
contents; at any rate both had concluded that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
chyle was changed within the portal vein into a crude
approximation to blood.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> That the same vessel should
carry to the liver altered chyle, and from the liver blood
to nourish the stomach and intestines, had involved a
difficulty which Galen had met with characteristic
cleverness. He had cited in support of such a reversal
of flow the flow of the bile into the gall-bladder and out
by the same duct, the movement of food and vomit into
and out of the stomach by the &oelig;sophagus, and the
relation of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">os uteri</i> to impregnation and parturition.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
Harvey says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"For the blood entering the mesentery by the c&oelig;liac artery
and the superior and inferior mesenteries proceeds to the intestines,
from which along with the chyle that has been attracted into the
veins it returns by their numerous ramifications into the vena portæ
of the liver, and from this into the vena cava, and this in such wise
that the blood in these veins has the same colour and consistency
as in other veins, in opposition to what many believe to be the fact.
Nor need we hold the improbable belief that two inconveniently opposed
movements take place in the whole capillary ramification,
namely, movement of the chyle upward, of the blood downward.
Is not the thing rather arranged as it is by the consummate providence
of nature? For were the chyle mingled with the blood, the
crude with the concocted in equal proportions, the result would
not be concoction, transmutation, and sanguification, but rather,
because they are reciprocally active and passive, a mixture, their
union with one another producing something intermediate, precisely
as when wine is mixed with water and [in] vinegar and water [oxicratum].
But when a minute quantity of chyle is mingled with a
large quantity of blood flowing by, a quantity of chyle that bears
no notable proportion to the blood, the effect is the same, as Aristotle
says, as when a drop of water is added to a cask of wine, or the
contrary; the resulting total is not a mixture, but is either wine or
water. So in the dissected mesenteric veins we do not find chyme
or chyle and blood, separate or mingled, but only blood, sensibly
the same in color and consistency as in the rest of the veins."<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>In a second passage of the same chapter,<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> Harvey
returns to this subject; and again, twenty-one years
later, in his first exercise to Riolanus, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Our learned author mentions a certain tract of his on the Circulation
of the Blood: I wish I could obtain a sight of it; perhaps
I might retract. But had the learned writer been so disposed, I
do not see but that, having admitted the circular motion of the
blood (and in the veins, as he says in the eighth chapter of the third
book,<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> the blood incessantly and naturally ascends, or flows back,
to the heart, as in all the arteries it descends or departs from the
heart), all the difficulties which were formerly felt in connection
with the distribution of chyle and the blood by the same channels
are brought to an equally satisfactory solution; for all the mooted
difficulties vanish when we cease to suppose two contrary motions
at once in the same vessels, and admit but one and the same continuous
motion in the mesenteric vessels from the intestines to the
liver."<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>From this passage we see, in passing, that Harvey
at the age of seventy made little account of Caspar
Aselli's discovery of the lacteals, published twenty-two
years before in 1627,<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> the year before the announcement
of the discovery of the circulation. Harvey's
mind was focused on the blood, its motion and its
meaning; this was to him the subject of prime importance.
The ancient doctrine of the feeding of the
tissues provided an insufficient reason for the existence
of what his observations and his experiments
revealed to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3>RESPIRATION AND THE CIRCULATION</h3>


<p>So the feeding of the tissues could not sufficiently
account, to Harvey's mind, for the swiftness of the
circulation. What could? It is easy for us to recite
the multitudinous modern duties of the blood as a
bearer of cells and of chemicals from point to point
and as a protector against poisoning; above all it is
easy to exclaim "respiration";&mdash;to read the most
striking part of the riddle by knowing the answer
which was wrung laboriously from Nature after Harvey
had died. It is easy for us to see that speedy death
from loss of the circulating blood is practically the
same as death from ligature of the arteries of the brain,
or from drowning, or strangulation, or a broken neck.
But this was veiled from him, and what best accounts
for the volume and swiftness of the Harveian circulation
was, in Harvey's day, a stumbling block to its
acceptance; for no adequate reason was apparent why
the whole mass of the blood should traverse the lungs,
or why, if the veins receive their blood from the arteries,
the venous blood should differ in color from the arterial.</p>

<p>Let us remember that throughout Harvey's life air
was still an elementary body in the eyes of many and,
for all, blood was a quite mysterious, ruddy, hot, vital
liquid. Only weak magnifying glasses were available
for him, and the powerful lenses of Malpighi and van
Leeuwenhoek had not yet revealed to the world either<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
capillary or blood-corpuscle. Moreover, the gossiping
John Aubrey, the man who had been advised about his
youthful studies by Harvey, wrote of him some years
after his death, that "he did not care for Chymistrey,
and was wont to speake against them [the chemists]
with an undervalue."<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> Where would physiology be
to-day, had not histology and chemistry long stood in
the forefront beside her?</p>

<p>In a passage of the treatise of 1628 Harvey speaks
of respiration, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"And now it has come to this, that it would seem better worth
while and more straightforward for those who seek the path by which
in man the blood passes through the vena cava into the left ventricle
and the venous artery,[20] to be willing to search for the truth by
dissecting animals, in order to look for the reason why in the larger
and more perfect animals, when full grown, nature chooses to make
the blood percolate through the parenchyma of the lungs rather
than take wide open paths as in all other animals (it being understood
that no other path and transit can be thought out):&mdash;whether
it is because the larger and more perfect animals are hotter
and when they are full grown their heat is more ignited, so to speak,
and prone to be smothered, that there is this permeation and
transfer through the lungs in order that the heat may be tempered
by the inspired air and guarded from boiling up and smothering&mdash;or
for some other similar reason. But to determine these matters
and explain them completely were to enter on a speculation as to
the purpose for which the lungs are made. About these and their
use and motion, and the whole subject of ventilation and the need
and use of air, and other matters of this sort, and about the various
different organs created in animals by reason thereof, although I
have made a vast number of observations, I shall not speak till I
can more conveniently set them forth in a treatise apart, lest by
wandering at this point too far from my subject, which is the motion
and use of the heart, I should seem to deal with something else and
leave my position, to confuse and evade the question."<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p class="noind">Farther on in the same treatise Harvey says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Moreover, the reason why the lungs have vessels so ample,
both vein and artery, that the trunk of the venous artery exceeds
in size the crural and jugular branches taken both together; and
the reason why the lungs are so full of blood as we know them to
be by experience and inspection (heeding Aristotle's warning,<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
and not deceived by the inspection of such lungs as we have removed
from dissected animals from which all the blood had flowed
out)&mdash;the reason is, that in the lungs and heart is the storehouse,
the source, the treasury of the blood, the workshop of its perfection."<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>So the great Englishman gropes for a moment or two
by the light of ancient Greek doctrines and puts the
question of respiration by. But this very attitude
shows Harvey's thought to be in such contrast with
the thought of to-day that in order to understand him
we need to learn more fully his views of respiration;
and we find with satisfaction that in his lecture notes
of more than eleven years before he had not put this
question by, for he had been called upon to lecture upon
the uses of the lungs. We must seek in his lecture notes,
therefore, for what he had thought those uses to be.
These notes, however, we shall be unable to follow
unless now, first of all, we shall give the floor for a while
to the ancients; for from their doctrines Harvey necessarily
took his cue, like the other thinkers of his time.</p>

<p>The momentous physiological facts that the living
body of man, beast, or bird, is warm of itself and that
its cooling means its death, must always have struck
and impressed the human mind, whether trained or untrained.
More than nineteen centuries before Harvey
certain thoughts of Aristotle were recorded as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In animals all the parts and the entire body possess a certain
innate natural heat; wherefore they are sensibly warm when living,
the reverse when making an end and parting with life. In the
animals which have blood the origin of this heat is necessarily in
the heart, in the bloodless kinds in the analogue thereof; for all
work up and concoct the nourishment by means of the natural
heat, the master part most of all. Life persists, therefore, when
the other parts are chilled; but if what resides in this one be so
affected total destruction ensues, because upon this part they all
depend as the source of their heat, the soul being as it were afire
within this part; that is, within the heart in the animals which
have blood, in the bloodless kinds in the analogue thereof. Necessarily,
therefore, the existence of life is coupled with the preservation
of the heat aforesaid, and what is called death is the destruction
thereof."<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>This heat which is innate in all living animals was
styled by Aristotle not only "innate" but "natural,"
"vital,"<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> and "physical,"<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> it being indispensable to
life and to the working of the soul. He held the continued
existence of the innate heat to depend upon conditions
similar to those under which a fire is kept alive,
viz.: protection both from burning out and from extinction
due to external forces. Yet the true nature of
combustion was not settled till more than a century
after Harvey's death. The fact that air is necessary
to fire must always have been a matter of common
knowledge. Therefore, the views of the relations of air
to fire maintained by Aristotle nearly twenty-one
centuries before the discovery of oxygen did not seem
naïve to Harvey, whatever they may seem to us.
Aristotle held that air exerts upon fire a cooling influence
which saves it from burning out too fast; and that
the same influence is exerted upon the vital innate heat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
of animals by the air which they breathe in, or the
water which bathes their gills.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> Moreover, Aristotle
says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Why those animals breathe most which have lungs containing
blood, is plain from this: that the warmer an animal is, the greater
need it has of cooling, while at the same time the breath passes
easily toward the source of warmth within the heart. But the
way in which the heart is pierced through toward the lung must
be studied from dissections and from the history of animals which
I have written. In general terms, then, it is the nature of animals
to need cooling on account of the firing of the soul within the
heart."<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="noind">In the treatise styled the "History of Animals," to
which he refers us, Aristotle says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"There are also channels from the heart which lead into the
lung and divide in the same way as the windpipe, and they accompany
the channels from the windpipe throughout the entire lung.
The channels from the heart lie uppermost; but no common channel
exists, for it is by contact<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> that they receive the breath and
transmit it to the heart."<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The collection of ancient Greek commonly called the
"Works of Hippocrates" is judged to be of the fifth
and fourth centuries <small>B.C.</small> There is included in this
collection a brief treatise on the heart; and in this
occurs the earliest known account of the structure and
use of the semilunar valves, which together with the
rest of the cardiac valves were unknown to Aristotle.
In the same Hippocratic treatise the doctrine is adhered
to of the entrance of air into the heart for cooling
purposes, both the right and the left ventricle being
specified as receiving it. The author says:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The vessel which leads out of the right ventricle ... closes
toward the heart, but closes imperfectly, in order that air may
enter, though not very much."<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="noind">This piece of incorrect physiology may well have received
support from the fact that the pulmonary semilunar
valve is commonly found to be not quite competent
when the dead and dissected pulmonary artery of
the bullock is distended with water&mdash;an observation
which the ancient author intimates that he has made,<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
though he does not specify the creature dissected.</p>

<p>Nearly five hundred years after the death of Aristotle,
the analogy between life and flame was discussed,
formally and at some length, by Galen. He knew his
Aristotle well, and agreed with him as to the importance
of respiratory cooling for protracting the indispensable
heat of animals.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> But we find Galen dealing with the
uses of respiration in a less simple way than Aristotle.
In a polemical treatise Galen debates the question
whether "the breath drawn in in respiration" actually
enters the heart, or whether it cools it without entering
it. He says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It is possible that the whole is breathed out again, as was
believed by most physicians and philosophers, and those the
keenest, who say that the heart, while it craves to be cooled, is in
need not of the substance, but of the quality<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> of the breath, and that
the use of respiration is indicated by the part.... I have
shown in my treatise on the use of respiration that either an absolutely
minute quantity, or none at all, of the substance of the air, is
taken into the heart."<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="noind">It is clear, however, that Galen, when delivering himself
of the foregoing, was a trifle carried away by the
ardor of contention; for in the very treatise to which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
he refers us, as well as elsewhere, he not only dilates
upon the cooling effects of breathing, but admits the
entrance of air into the heart for a definite physiological
purpose. This purpose, however, which we shall
study later, is not cooling and is counted of secondary
importance by Galen. Nevertheless, he goes so far
as to say this:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"That some portion of the air is drawn into the heart in its
diastole and fills the vacuum which is produced, is sufficiently shown
by the very magnitude of the dilation."<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="noind">In his treatise "On the Use of the Parts of the Human
Body" Galen takes a more judicial tone in the following
brief, calm summary:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The use of the respiration of animals arises from the heart,
as has been shown. The heart itself needs in some sort the substance
of the air; but, first and foremost, it craves to be cooled,
because it boils with heat. The heart is cooled by the cool quality
of inspiration; but expiration also cools, by pouring out that which
seethes within the heart and is, in a way, burned up and sooty."<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="noind">Thus do we see the modern products of respiration
foreshadowed.</p>

<p>Galen believed that the heat of animals is safeguarded
also by the entrance of cooling air through the pores of
the skin into the arterial system, and by the exit through
these pores of injurious fumes out of the arteries.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> In
the introduction to Harvey's great treatise of 1628<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>
the English physician riddles with adverse arguments
this doctrine of Galen; to this we shall return later,
as we shall to Galen's belief that the brain draws cooling
air directly into its ventricles out of the nares through
the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>In passing from Aristotle to Galen we have crossed
nearly five centuries. Now let us pass at a leap across
fourteen centuries more, from Galen at imperial Rome
under Septimius Severus to Harvey at London under
King James the First. Having briefly scanned the doctrines
of the Greeks, let us take up our study of respiration
in Harvey's private lecture notes of 1616. His
crabbed handwriting has been deciphered by experts,
and his notes have been both photographed and printed.
If we seek therein for his thoughts about respiration,
and track them through the jungle of abbreviated
careless Latin and racy English in which they were
jotted down, we shall find them Galenic in part, but
also denying a truth which Galen had accepted. Harvey's
notes are often too disconnected for quotation,
calling rather for paraphrase or summary; and to
make either is a task which one cannot approach without
diffidence, especially as this task involves translation
also. Of what I have ventured to prepare to
represent parts of Harvey's note-book in the present
paper some passages are simple translations, such
English words as Harvey interspersed being transcribed.
Naturally such passages are included between
quotation marks. These are not used, however, in the
case of a paraphrase or summary, even if it contains
scattered English words which are Harvey's own.</p>

<p>Harvey fully shared the ancient view of the supreme
importance of the heat of animals. In his note-book
he, like Galen, deals with respiration under the heads:
first, of a possible absorption of some of the substance
of the air; and, second, of cooling and ventilation.
Let us first take up the second head. Harvey says:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Without nourishment life cannot be, nor nourishment without
concoction, nor concoction without heat, nor heat without
ventilation;" for heat perishes either of wasting or of smothering;
"so there is cooling and ventilation of the native heat,
ventilation especially."<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="noind">His words contain reminders of Aristotle;<a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> and he
continues about respiration in a vein as ancient as
Hippocrates,<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Nothing is so necessary, neither sense nor food. Life and respiration
are convertible terms, for there is no life without breathing
and no breathing without life. If the eye be cut out there is
an end of seeing; if the legs be cut off there is an end of walking;
if the tongue, of speech, <i>et cetera</i>; if respiration, there is an end of
everything immediately."<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="noind">When Harvey jotted this down he had in mind a
Galenic passage which doubtless had become the common
property of all physicians in his day; for the
removal of eye and legs figures in the first chapter of
Galen "On the Use of Respiration."<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> Harvey continues:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Hence large animals are much warmer and breathe frequently,
because they have need of greater cooling and ventilation inasmuch
as they very greatly abound in blood and heat."<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="noind">In the margin opposite this passage there is written:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Why and how air is needed by animals which breathe and also
air is necessary to a candle and to fire see W. H."</p></blockquote>

<p class="noind">We may conjecture that this note refers to Harvey's
promised treatise on respiration, which was never
published.</p>

<p>So far Harvey has simply reiterated the ancient
doctrine of cooling and ventilation, as in the passages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
quoted previously from the treatise of 1628. We shall
find it very interesting to see how he deals with the
other ancient doctrine that some of the substance of
the air joins the blood in respiration. That this is
true, gas analysis and the mercurial air-pump have
taught us; but in this matter modern demonstration
does but confirm, extend, and make precise one of the
oldest of physiological beliefs. Regarding this we
must now give the floor once again to the ancients, in
order to make Harvey comprehensible.</p>

<p>Even in the days of Empedocles and Hippocrates,
in the fifth and fourth centuries before Christ, men
wrote of something derived from the outer air being
present, for the use of the organism, in the vessels
which also contain the blood.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> To express this derivative
of the outer air the ancient Greeks employed
the word "<i lang="el" xml:lang="el">pneuma</i>" (πνεῦμα), the fundamental meaning
of which seems to have been "air in motion."
Various meanings were acquired by "<i lang="el" xml:lang="el">pneuma</i>," such
as the breath of living things, the wind, or simply the
air, or what we mean by the words "gas," "vapor,"
"steam," "exhalation," "emanation." The Latin word
equivalent to "<i lang="el" xml:lang="el">pneuma</i>" is "<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">spiritus</i>," and so the English
derivative of this, the word "spirits," came into
use to express various meanings of the Greek "<i lang="el" xml:lang="el">pneuma</i>."
A Hippocratic writer tells us that "the spirits cannot
stand still, but go up and down" in the blood vessels.
The word "spirits" here designates a derivative of the
outer air crudely mingled with the blood.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> To this
writer the distinction between veins and arteries was
unknown.</p>

<p>In the genuine works of Aristotle this Hippocratic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
doctrine does not reappear, though it is fairly certain
that Hippocratic treatises which contain it were written
before Aristotle's time. We have seen that the entrance
of air into the heart, to cool the same, is an important
feature of the Aristotelian physiology. Beyond
the Aristotelian heart, however, we cannot trace the
air which enters it. Yet we find "<i lang="el" xml:lang="el">pneuma</i>," "spirits,"
referred to by Aristotle, not seldom obscurely or in
very general terms, as doing service, sometimes momentous
service, in the physiology of generation and
in certain workings within the bodies of full-grown
creatures. In disease also spirits may play a very
important part. These Aristotelian spirits, however,
when their origin can be traced at all, are either innate
or appear to be vapor produced within the body itself
by heat or by disease. They do not appear to be
recruited from the outer air which has penetrated the
lungs and heart, that air seeming to complete its
function within the lungs or within the heart itself by
sustaining the native heat which is the great instrument
of the soul, and in which the very soul itself is fired.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>Physicians of Aristotle's time, however, revived and
handed on the doctrine that not only blood but a
derivative of the air is distributed to the body at large
through the vessels. After the distinction between
veins and arteries had been clearly made and the latter
had received their present name, a striking modification
of this doctrine of the spirits was adopted and pressed
by the Greek physician Erasistratus, about 300 <small>B.C.</small>,
not many years after the death of Aristotle. This
modified doctrine separated the paths taken within the
vessels by the blood and the spirits derived from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
air, and declared the transmission of the necessary
blood to the body at large to be by the veins only, that
of the necessary spirits, styled "vital," to be by the
arteries only. More than four hundred and fifty
years later Galen shattered this doctrine and incorporated
the vital spirits in the arteries with the blood,
which he proved by epoch-making experiments to be
normally present in the arteries, he, however, clearly
recognizing differences between the cruder blood in the
veins and the spirituous blood in the arteries. The
tissues, therefore, still received vital spirits by way of
the arteries, according to Galen, but not spirits in their
pure gaseous Erasistratean state.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> Now let Galen
tell us more in his own words:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The breath from the windpipes, which had been drawn in from
without, is worked up in the flesh of the lungs in the first place;
in the second place in the heart and arteries, and especially in
those of the net-like plexus; and to perfection in the ventricles of
the brain, where the spirits become completely animal. But what
the use may be of these animal spirits and why we have the temerity
to call them so, when we confess that we are still utterly ignorant
as to the substance of the anima [<i>i.e.</i>, of the soul], this is not the
moment to say."<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The complex physiology of this passage is so obsolete
that its very phraseology is meaningless without a commentary.
In the first place, what are the animal
spirits? This expression, once a technical term of
physiology, survives only in colloquial English, and
even there merely as a label of which the origin is
known to few. In this phrase the adjective "animal"
does not refer to lower creatures as opposed to man,
but is used in its obsolete original sense of "pertaining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
to the soul," for which latter the Latin word is "<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">anima</i>,"
the Greek word "<i lang="el" xml:lang="el">psyche</i>" (πσυχή). "Psychical spirits"
would best translate into the English of to-day either
the original Greek expression "<i lang="el" xml:lang="el">pneuma psychikon</i>"
(πνεῦμα ψυχικόν) or its Latin equivalent "<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">spiritus
animalis</i>." But the expression "animal spirits" was
for too long a time an English technical term to be
superseded now. These animal spirits, that is, spirits
of the soul, were not peculiar to man, but were possessed
by lower creatures also; for neither the Latin word
"<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">anima</i>" nor the Greek word "<i lang="el" xml:lang="el">psyche</i>" implied immortality,
as the English word "soul" is now so commonly
understood to do. Plato formally recognized a
mortal and an immortal part of the human psyche;<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>
and Aristotle admitted the existence in animals lower
than man of the lower grades of psyche, and conceded
the lowest grade even to plants.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> The perfected animal
spirits were of the very highest physiological importance,
as their name implies, they being for Galen no less than
"the first instrument of the soul,"<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> and thus assuming
the lofty rank given by Aristotle to the native heat.
For Galen the animal spirits were the medium of sensation
and volition and were imparted by the ventricles
of the brain to the spinal cord and nerves, the fibers
of which were believed, accordingly, to consist of tubes
in which the subtile animal spirits were contained, the
bore of these tubes being too small to be visible.</p>

<p>We can now follow the quoted Galenic passage and
trace the full significance of that entrance of the substance
of the air into the heart which Galen repeatedly
acknowledged, though sometimes grudgingly. According
to Galen whatever air was taken into the heart had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
first been "concocted" in "the flesh of the lungs."
Next, this aërial substance had been worked up in the
heart with the vapor of the blood into vital spirits, and
these became incorporated with the finer blood destined
for the arteries. Moreover, as each arterial diastole was
due to an active expansion of the arterial wall, at each
diastole there became blended with the contents of the
arteries still more of the substance of the air, which was
sucked into the arterial skin through the countless
pores of the bodily skin, these being too fine to permit
bleeding. The vital spirits, thus formed and modified,
were blended with the blood of the arteries and supplied
to the body at large. A part of these vital spirits
mounted with the blood into the carotid arteries. In
the swine and the ruminants, notably in the calf, the
branch given to the brain by each carotid artery breaks
up at the base of the skull within the cranial cavity
into numerous fine twigs, which form collectively a
net-work, styled in the passage from Galen already
quoted the "net-like plexus." This plexus is called
by modern anatomists the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">rete mirabile</i>. It was falsely
assumed by Galen to exist in man. The plexuses of the
two sides anastomose freely across the median line,
and through them passes the entire blood supply of
the brain; in the animals which possess them these
plexuses seem the terminal branches of the vertebral
arteries also. The small vessels of each net-like plexus
reunite, and thus reconstitute the artery of the brain
before this artery has pierced the dura mater. Galen
regarded the net-like plexus as an organ of much importance
intercalated in the course of the artery for the
still further elaboration of the vital spirits, which, thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
altered, were exhaled from the cerebral arteries into
the cerebral ventricles.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> In these ventricles the spirits
attained their final perfection, becoming "completely
animal," by the aid of still more of the substance of the
air, which the diastole of the pulsating brain had
drawn into its cavities directly from the nares through
the numerous holes in the ethmoid bones. It is a
striking fact in this connection that in some of the
domestic animals on each side of the head the cavity
of the nares is separated from the ventricular cavity
of the brain by an exceedingly thin, though complex,
partition: as may be seen on dissection, if the nares
and the brain <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in situ</i> be opened at the same time.</p>

<p>Now let Galen speak again as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I have clearly shown that the brain is, in a way, the source of
the animal spirits, watered and fed by inspiration and by the
abundance supplied from the net-like plexus. The proof was not
so clear as to the vital spirits, but we may deem it not at all unlikely
that they exist, contained in the heart and arteries, they, too,
fed by respiration mainly, but to some degree by the blood also. If
there be such a thing as the natural spirits, these would be found
contained in the liver and veins."<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="noind">The animal spirits were sustained, as we have seen, by
three kinds of respiration which might be called pulmonary,
cutaneous and cerebral. We may perhaps
conjecture that it was largely Galen's acceptance of the
two latter, the last especially, which enabled him sometimes
to treat as doubtful the entrance into the heart
of that air from which the vital spirits were held to be
derived. Of the natural spirits he evidently made
small account.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p>A modern physiologist, musing upon all this, might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
see in the vital spirits a dim foreshadowing of oxyhæmoglobin;
might see in the operation of the animal spirits
a plainer foreshadowing of the nerve impulse of to-day.</p>

<p>Some account, such as the foregoing, of the very
complex ancient doctrine of the spirits is indispensable
for the study of Harvey; for that doctrine, more or
less modified, was still the accepted medical doctrine
of his time. After this renewed study of the ancients
let us now return again to Harvey's note-book at the
place where he takes up the question of the action of
the lungs upon the blood otherwise than by the cooling
and ventilation of the innate heat. It is necessary in
his opinion that a further concoction of the blood into
spirituous arterial blood should be accomplished by the
fleshy parenchyma of the lungs in animals which require
a warmer, thinner, "sprightly kind of aliment," as
his own English styles it.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> The probability of such a
concoction is shown by the separation of excreta which
indicate it, such as sputa, at the lung.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> On the other
hand, in such creatures as frogs and turtles the lungs
are fleshless, spongy, and vesicular, and give no sign of
blood or excreta. Hence we may infer that the pulmonary
concoction of the blood, though it probably
occurs, is limited to such animals as possess fleshy and
sanguinolent lungs. Hence, again, it follows that the
concoction aforesaid is a function of secondary importance,
because it is not universal; and that the
foremost function of the lungs is their motion, the
windpipes constituting their most important part,
rather than the parenchyma.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> Two functions of the
lungs, says Harvey, are affirmed by the medical authorities:
first, the cooling and tempering of the blood;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
second, the preparation of natural spirits and air to be
made into vital spirits in the heart. From all this there
result the excreta of pulmonary concoction, which
are something between water and air, and the fumes
which are breathed out in expiration continually and
incessantly. Harvey observes correctly that Realdus
Columbus had declared himself to have discovered the
continual motion of the lung to be the means whereby
the spirits are prepared; the blood being thinned by
the agitation, thoroughly mixed with air, beaten, and
prepared.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> Harvey also cites Galen as saying that
the parenchyma of the lung concocts spirits out of air
as the flesh of the liver concocts the blood.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> On
turning to the Galenic passage cited by Harvey one
finds that it is out of the food that the blood is thus
concocted by the liver.</p>

<p>Realdus Columbus, to whom Harvey refers, was the
Italian anatomist who in 1559, fifty-seven years before
the Harveian circulation was verbally announced,
gave to the world the important truth that such blood as
the right ventricle imparts to the left reaches the latter
by traversing the pores of the texture of the lungs,<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>
instead of the pores of the septum of the ventricles, as
Galen had taught. The existence of these pores of
the septum Vesalius had pointedly wondered at in 1543
and had emphatically doubted in 1555.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> Four years
later his former assistant and temporary successor,
Columbus, flatly denied the existence of the pores.
It was natural, therefore, that in the same book in
which Columbus brought forward the path through
the lungs to replace that through the septum he should
declare that the vital spirits are made out of air worked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
up with the blood in the lungs and then merely perfected
in the left ventricle. This doctrine was an
important advance beyond what Galen had taught, viz.:
that the spirits are but slightly prepared in the lungs
out of air and then sent to the left ventricle to undergo
their main preparation and to be worked up therein
with the blood which had filtered into it directly out
of the right ventricle.</p>

<p>So much for the views of the medical authorities.
We have found Harvey agreeing with them that the
ancient doctrine of the cooling and ventilation of the
native heat by respiration is sound. We have found
him acknowledging that in some animals some sort of
concoction also of the blood destined for the arteries
may be brought about by the pulmonary parenchyma
as a function of secondary importance. But now we
shall find him rejecting the second accepted doctrine
of the physicians, viz.: that some of the substance of
the air is taken into the pulmonary vessels and enters
the blood. This conjecture had had believers for two
thousand years, and was destined to be proved true
triumphantly after Harvey's death. In rejecting it
he threw away a precious clue to the meaning of his
own great discovery.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It is more philosophical," he says, "not to share the common
belief that the spirits are distinct and separate from the humors
and parts because the spirits are produced in diverse places or
contained in diverse things," but to hold that the spirits and the
blood are one thing, like the cream and watery part (serum) in
milk or, to borrow a simile from Aristotle's reasonings about the
blood,<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> like heat and water in hot water, or like flame and a vapor
which feeds it (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nidor</i>). As light is to a candle, so are the spirits to
the blood.<a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p class="noind">In this passage the discoverer's thought rises high,
but in the next it stoops again. The next passage is
headed "Spirits not from air"; and Harvey says in
effect, as I understand his difficult words:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>If spirits are made by concoction out of air, the air is made either
thinner or thicker in the process. If made thick, how does it get
from the windpipes into the venous artery? If the spirits be thinner
than air, how are they held<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> by the tunic of the lung, since this
lets pass the pus and serum of empyema?<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="noind">In the treatise of 1628 Harvey says that Laurentius</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"asserts and proves that, in empyema, serosities and pus absorbed
from the cavity of the chest into the venous artery may be expelled
and got rid of with the urine and fæces through the left ventricle
of the heart and the arteries."<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="noind">Harvey's argument in his note-book continues thus:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"How, since mixture consists in the union of altered matters, can
air be thoroughly mixed and made one with blood? What is that
which mixes and alters? If it be heat, the air is made thinner
thereby. If it be urged that the air is thickened by cold during
preparation (which is impossible in the lungs), then Aristotle's<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>
argument holds good: if spirits be from the air, how about fishes,
which are agile and abound in spirits?"<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>At this point we may call to mind passages in the
introduction to Harvey's treatise of 1628, published
more than eleven years after he had written the notes
which we are now studying. In one of these passages
he speaks of what is now called the pulmonary vein,
saying:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"If it be contended that fumes and air pass to and fro by this road,
as through the bronchia of the lungs, why can we find neither air
nor fumes on dissection, when the venous artery has been cut out or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
cut into? And how comes it that we always see the aforesaid venous
artery to be full of thick blood and never of air, while we perceive
that there is air remaining in the lungs?"<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="noind">Immediately after the foregoing passage Harvey says
that should an experimenter</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"make a cut in the trachea of a living dog, forcibly fill the lungs
with air by means of a bellows and, when they have been distended,
apply a firm ligature, on opening the chest shortly after, he would
find great abundance of air in the lungs, up to their outermost
tunic, but none at all in the venous artery or in the left ventricle
of the heart. If in the living dog the heart drew air out of the
lungs or the lungs transmitted it, much more ought they to do so
in this experiment. Who, indeed, could doubt that even in a dissection,
if the lungs of a dead body had been inflated, air would
enter at once, as aforesaid, did any passages exist?"<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Yet we have found Aristotle, more than nineteen
centuries before Harvey, recognizing that no passages
are needed for the transfer of air out of the windpipe,
and saying, of the channels from the heart, that "it is
by contact that they receive the breath<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> and transmit
it to the heart."<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> Moreover, sixty-nine years before
Harvey's publication Columbus had repeatedly recommended
the experiment of opening the venous
artery<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> in a living dog and noting that the "said
venous artery" is full of blood, not of air or fumes.
But Columbus held this observation rather to confirm
than to disprove his doctrine that the blood in the
venous artery is imbued with vital spirits derived in
the lungs from the substance of the air. Indeed, he goes
so far as to call the contents of this vessel "modified
blood and air."<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> In this matter the earlier observer,
Columbus, shows keener insight than the later, Harvey.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>Decidedly, however, the stage waits for the chemists,
despite Harvey's poor opinion of them. Despite that
poor opinion, too, Harvey himself turns to making chemical
conjectures in the next passage of his note-book,
to the study of which latter we will now return. The
passage is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Conclusion. Opinion of W. H.</p>

<p>"In animals in which lungs are fleshy and full of blood these
concoct the blood, seeing that spirits and blood are one thing, in
the same way that the liver does and by reason of the same arguments;
indeed, the lungs may rather detain fatty and oleaginous
vapor by a cooling process, as oil or balsam or nutritious fat is
cooled in alembic and serpentina"<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>&mdash;</p></blockquote>

<p class="noind">"alembic" and "serpentina" answering to the "still"
and "worm" of the modern distiller. Harvey, therefore,
utilizes the Galenic analogy between concoction
in the lungs and that of the blood and the vapors thereof,
rejecting not only Galen's preliminary concoction of air
into spirits in the lungs, but also Columbus's union in
the lungs of blood with spirits produced in the lungs
themselves out of air. Of the entrance of "the substance
of air" into the blood Harvey makes emphatic
denial and, by so doing, reduces the spirits either to
emanations from ingredients of the body itself (thus
reminding us of Aristotle), or to a mere name with
which to label qualities of the blood, in treating of
which he often uses the word "spirits" as a current
term. Naturally, therefore, where in his lecture notes
he treats of the spirits in relation to the brain and
nerves his conclusions are not clearly defined, but seem
consistent with his views as to the spirits in the blood,
though his jotted words are not very easy to understand.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
On this subject he refers by name to Galen,
three alternatives discussed by whom appear to be
reviewed by Harvey, viz.: that sensation and motion
result either from a progression from elsewhere of
spirits in substance along and within the nerves; or
from a vibration of spirits in substance which have their
native seat within the nerves; or, lastly, from no movement
of a substance, but from a transfer of "faculty"
along the nerves by means of progressive qualitative
alteration thereof, "such as is produced in air by the
brightness of the sun."<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> Of these three alternatives,
the last seems to commend itself most to Harvey, as
we should expect; the second, next; and the first, not
at all;&mdash;that is, if one may so interpret the following
brief passage of his lecture notes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I believe that in the nerves there is no progression of spirits,
but irradiation; and that the actions from which sensation and
motion result are brought about as light is in air, perhaps as the
flux and reflux of the sea."<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="noind">Also we find Harvey long years afterward saying to
Riolanus:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Moreover, the spirits, animal, natural, vital, which dwell,
contained within blind windings, in solid parts, to wit, in ligaments
and nerves (especially if there be so many kinds),&mdash;these spirits
are not to be regarded as so many diverse aëreal forms, nor as so
many kinds of vapors."<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>In Harvey's lecture notes the subject of respiration is
brought to an end with an abrupt interrogation, which
seems to reveal a sudden return of doubt as to whether
too much may not have been conceded in admitting a
pulmonary concoction of any sort. We read:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"N.B. If the blood receive concoction in the lungs, why does
it not traverse the lungs in the embryo?"<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>It would seem to be Harvey's tendency to adhere to
the view which limited the use of respiration entirely to
the cooling and ventilation of the innate heat, by which
according to ancient doctrine the heart was the central
hearth, embedded in the cooling and ventilating lungs;
although this ancient doctrine tallied well in most eyes
with the belief that only a portion of the blood ever
entered the heart at all.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> In the first of the two Exercises
which Harvey, when seventy years old, in 1649,
addressed to Riolanus in defense of the circulation, the
ancient respiratory cooling and ventilation take their
place again as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Thus by the aid of two extremes, viz.: cold and heat, is the
temperature of the animal body retained at its mean. For as the
air inspired tempers the too great heat of the blood in the lungs and
centre of the body and effects the expulsion of suffocating fumes,
so in its turn does the hot blood, thrown through the arteries into the
entire body, cherish and nourish and keep alive all the extremities,
preventing extinction due to the power of external cold."<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="noind">In none of the writings of his old age does Harvey deal
expressly with concoction in the lungs, or more than
cursorily with the entrance of the substance of air into
the blood. But he repeatedly and emphatically reaffirms
that blood and spirits are one thing;<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> he even
declares the blood in comparison with the other parts
of the body to be "possessed of powers of action beyond
all the rest, and therefore, in virtue of its preëminence,
meriting the title of spirit."<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> He castigates those
who give the rein to overmuch speculation about the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
spirits. We learn that some suppose that the spirits
"are engendered and are fed and increased from the
thinner part of the blood"; that others suppose "the
primigenial moisture" to engender and support them.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>
Then there are "those who tell us that the spirits are
formed in the heart, being compounded of the vapours
or exhalations of the blood (excited either by the heat
of the heart or the agitation) and the inspired air"<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>&mdash;the
Galenic doctrine.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Such spirits," says Harvey of these last mentioned, "are rather
to be regarded as fumes and excrementitious effluvia of the blood
and body, like odours, than as natural artificers; ... whence it
seems probable also that pulmonary expiration is for the ventilation
and purifying of the blood by the breathing out of these;
while inspiration is in order that the blood, in passing through between
the two ventricles of the heart, may be tempered by the
ambient cold; lest the blood, being hot and swollen, blown up in
a sort of ferment, like milk and honey boiling up, should so distend
the lungs that the animal would be suffocated."<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="noind">As we read these words, published in Harvey's old age,
we recollect the following words, written in his note-book
more than thirty-three years before, viz.: "So
there is cooling and ventilation of the native heat,
ventilation especially."<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>

<p>We may recall also that the preservation of the native
heat had sufficed to explain respiration to Harvey's
ancient teacher, Aristotle, while the tenor of Aristotle's
genuine works well accords with the following dictum
which we have found in Harvey's note-book: "Spirits
not from air." Yet the more firmly this dictum was upheld,
and the more simply Aristotelian in principle did
Harvey's doctrine of respiration remain, so much the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
less called for must have seemed that swift and endlessly
repeated passage through the lungs of the whole mass
of the blood, which was involved in the Harveian circulation.</p>

<p>In the actual phenomena of respiration, however,
positive obstacles confronted the doctrine of the circulation
which were harder to surmount than cobwebs
of speculation, or than the mere question "<i lang="el" xml:lang="el">cui bono</i>"
which latter the steadfast observer could simply wave
aside. Spirits or no spirits, there were opponents of
the circulation, even in Harvey's old age, who insisted
that the blood in the arteries was so different from
the blood in the veins that the same blood could not
be changing perpetually from arterial to venous, and
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vice versa</i>. There was always that stubborn difference
of color, plainly to be seen in man and beast, but so hard
to account for in Harvey's day. Therefore, we find
Harvey leaving the realm of subtleties and taking up
his old weapon of demonstration, in order to minimize
the differences between arterial and venous blood.
Twenty years after the publication of his discovery he
says to Riolanus:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"You may also perform another experiment at the same time.
If you fill two cups of the same measurement with blood, one with
that which issues by leaps from an artery, the other with venous
blood from a vein of the same animal, you can observe the sensible
differences between the two, both immediately and later, when the
blood in either cup has become coagulated and cold. This experiment
will contradict those who pretend that the blood in the
arteries is of one kind, that in the veins of another, on the ground
that that in the arteries is more florid and seethes and is blown up
with copious spirits, I know not how, like milk or honey boiling
upon the fire, swelling and filling a larger space. For, were the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
blood which is thrown from the left ventricle of the heart into the
arteries fermented thus into a frothy and flatulent condition, so
that a drop or two distended the whole cavity of the aorta, unquestionably,
upon the subsidence of this fermentation, the volume of
the blood would return to that of a few drops (and this is, indeed,
the reason that some assign for the empty state of the arteries in
the dead body); and this would be apparent in the cup which is
full of arterial blood, for so we find it to happen in milk and honey
when they come to cool. But if in both cups you find blood nearly
of the same colour, not of very different consistency in the coagulated
state, forcing out serum in the same manner and filling each cup
to the same height when cold that it did when hot, this will be
enough for any one to rest his faith upon, and afford argument
enough, I think, for rejecting the dreams of certain people. On
investigation sense and reason alike assure us that the blood of the
left ventricle is not of a different kind from that of the right....
The blood, then, when imbued with spirits to the utmost, is not
swollen with them, or fermented or blown up so as to crave and
require more ample room (as can be determined with the greatest
certainty on trial by the measurement of the cups); we should
rather understand this blood to be possessed, after the manner of
wine, of greater strength, and of an impetus to action and effectiveness,
in accordance with the view of Hippocrates.</p>

<p>"So the blood in the arteries is the same as that in the veins;
even though the former be acknowledged more spirituous and
possessed of greater vital force; but the blood in the arteries is not
converted into something more aëreal or rendered more vaporous;
as though there were no spirits not aëreal, nor anything which
gives an impetus except wind and flatulence."<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>It is well, one may be inclined to mutter, as one reads
this, but how about the color? It may be nearly the
same, but certainly there is a difference. In his book
"On Generation" Harvey himself describes in more detail
the changes which occur in shed blood on standing,
and says: "Of the red parts the upper are more florid,
those below are blackish." In the same description<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
he refers shortly after to "the florid and ruddy part
which is commonly thought to be arterial blood."<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>
The words last quoted evidently refer to the upper part
of coagulating blood as commonly seen. This in medical
practice would be blood drawn from a vein, and
Harvey says nothing of arteriotomy in this passage.
Indeed, he refers in the context to venesection; and
earlier in the same chapter he wrote: "Physicians
observe only human blood, and this shed by venesection
into a basin, and coagulated."<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

<p>The foregoing passages show at once that opinions
had been clarified very little by the suggestive change
of color caused in shed blood by contact with air.
Years before, in jotting down his lecture notes, Harvey
had noted that the arterial blood is redder;<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> Galen
had known it;<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> it must always have been known. In
1649 Harvey wrote:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Three things are especially apt to give rise to this opinion of
the diversity of the blood: the first is that the blood which is drawn
in arteriotomy is more florid....<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> Whenever and wherever
blood issues through a narrow orifice it is strained, as it were, and
the thinner and lighter part, which usually swims on top and is
the more penetrating, is emitted."<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="noind">A number of observations follow, of appearances noted
in nosebleed, in the use of leeches, in cupping, and in
blood-letting from veins and arteries. All these appearances
are adduced in support of the view that it is
the straining of the blood which renders it more florid,
and they all show that the brightening of the color of
shed blood on exposure to air served only to lead Harvey
off on a false scent. Continuing he refers, as follows, to
direct inspection of the dissected lungs:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The blood is found to be much more florid within the lungs and
after it is squeezed out of them, than in the arteries."<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="noind">A few pages farther on he states, categorically, the false
conclusion to which he has been driven, saying:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It is no less plain why the blood of the lungs is so ruddy; for
it is thinner, because there it is filtered through."<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Nothing indicates better Harvey's readiness to minimize
the essential differences between venous and
arterial blood than a passage in the treatise of 1628,
in which he says that, compared with the left ventricle,
the right ventricle "is of greater capacity, that it may
supply not only matter to the left ventricle, but also
nourishment to the lungs."<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> It should be remembered
that, in Harvey's day, the so-called bronchial arteries
were still unknown, through which the tissues of the
lungs are supplied with arterial blood from the aorta.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a>
Not only Columbus,<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> but even Galen,<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> had each
devised an erroneous way in which to provide the
lungs with "spirituous" or "vital" blood, in addition
to the venous blood from the right ventricle; but Harvey
is obviously content to let the latter suffice for their
nutrition.</p>

<p>What has gone before indicates how erroneous it is
to speak of the pulmonary transit, as Columbus had
set it forth in 1559, nineteen years before Harvey's
birth, as though Columbus were in some sort a sharer
in the discovery of the circulation. Those who so
speak fail to note the difference between blood and <em>the</em>
blood. Although Columbus girded at Galen and corrected
him, Columbus's pulmonary transit of a fraction
of the blood by curing more than one defect of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
Galenic doctrine strengthened the erroneous Galenic
physiology of the blood-movement. Of these larger
features Columbus not only was no enemy, but remained
a devoted adherent. His doctrine certainly paved the
way for Harvey's, but in no more immediate sense than
did Galen's doctrine that blood is naturally contained
in the arteries.<a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

<p>Indeed, Harvey categorically stated that the movement
of blood through the lungs had nothing to do with
his discovery. In a Latin letter from London written
in 1651 to P. M. Siegel in Hamburg, Harvey says in
his old age:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Meantime, as Riolanus uses his utmost efforts to oppose the
passage of blood into the left ventricle through the lungs, and
brings it all hither through the septum, and so vaunts himself as
having upset the very foundation of the Harveian circulation,
(although I have nowhere laid that down as a foundation for my
circulation; for the blood fetches a circuit in very many red-blooded
animals in which no lungs are to be found), it may be well here to
relate an experiment which I lately tried in the presence of several
of my colleagues, and from the cogency of which there is no escape."<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="noind">The parenthesis certainly is a striking one.</p>

<p>No less striking is the last word published by Harvey
about respiration. We have heard him deny the
entrance of air into the blood and doubt the occurrence
of any concoction in the lungs. Now we shall hear
him throw over even the cooling of the innate heat, a
respiratory doctrine to which he has seemed hitherto to
hold with conviction. In the essay "On Parturition"
published in 1651 with the treatise "On Generation,"
he says:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In the meantime I would propose this question to the learned:
How comes it that the f&oelig;tus continues in its mother's womb after
the seventh month? If brought forth at that time it breathes
at will, indeed could not survive one little hour without breathing;
yet, as I have said, if it remain in the womb it keeps alive and
well beyond the ninth month without the aid of respiration....
Whoso shall attend carefully to these things and consider more
closely the nature of air, will, I think, readily grant that air is given
to animals neither for cooling nor as nutriment; for it is a fact that
after the f&oelig;tus has once drawn breath it may be suffocated more
quickly than when entirely excluded from the air; as though
heat were unkindled by air within the f&oelig;tus rather than allayed.
Thus much, merely by the way, on the subject of respiration;
perhaps I shall treat of it more fully in its proper place. Surely a
more knotty subject could hardly be found, as the arguments on
both sides are very evenly balanced."<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>So we find Harvey in his old age induced by lifelong
study to question, if not deny, even the cooling effects
of respiration, and to end with a practical confession of
ignorance. Instead, therefore, of the circulation and
its swiftness being explained by the urgent need of
"the substance of the air" experienced by certain tissues,
that movement of the whole mass of the blood
through the lungs, which was so novel a physiological
fact, does not seem to have affected his view of the
problems of respiration. Nor could he properly explain
the respiratory change in the color of the blood, which
seemed to support the ancient doctrine that the blood
is of two different kinds. Since he could not invoke
respiration to elucidate the circulation and its rapidity,
and since he himself declared that such rapidity could
not be needed for the simple feeding of the tissues, what
was left to be invoked? It is no wonder that eight
years<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> after the publication of his discovery Harvey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
denied that he had ever seriously undertaken to explain
the use of the circulation; that at the end of thirteen
years more he repeated this denial in his old age;<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>
although he had not refrained from expressing such conjectures
as must always be evoked in the mind of a
great observer by a discovery of the first importance
made by himself. Yet the phenomena of the very
circulation used were so striking as to cry aloud for
elucidation; for Harvey's own clinching statement that
the heart drives into the aorta at least one thousand
drachms of blood in half an hour,<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> this <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">reductio ad
absurdum</i>, which cut the ground from under the feet of
his opponents, left him helpless in his turn to account
for the need of so huge a flooding of the arteries.</p>

<p>Since it was not to be swiftly altered in the lungs that
the whole mass of the blood hurried back from all parts
of the chest, what then?</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3>THE CIRCULATION AND THE ARISTOTELIAN PRIMACY OF
THE HEART</h3>


<p>It has been stated already that the first announcement
of the circulation is to be found in Harvey's
lecture notes. The following is the text of the memorable
passage in question, which I have translated from
Harvey's Latin. He says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It is proved by the structure of the heart that the blood is perpetually
transferred through the lungs into the aorta, as by two
clacks of a water-bellows to rayse water. It is proved by the ligature
that there is a transit of the blood from the arteries to the
veins; whereby it is demonstrated that a perpetual movement of
the blood in a circle is brought about by the beat of the heart. Is
this for the sake of nutrition, or of the better preservation of the
blood and members by infusion of heat, the blood in turn being
cooled by heating the members and heated by the heart?"<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="noind">The words "as by two clacks of a water-bellows to rayse
water" are Harvey's own racy English, embedded in
his Latin text. The "ligature" is the flat band which
is tied about the upper arm when bleeding from a vein
is to be practised at the bend of the elbow. The Hippocratic
physicians called this band a "<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">taenia</i>,"<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> and
even in their day it was known to hasten the flow of
blood from the opened vein when applied as above
stated, but yet to check the flow if tied too tight. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
clinical observation had awaited a rational explanation
for more than nineteen centuries.<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p>

Transcript of the preceding page.
</p></div>
</div>

<p>Our most immediate interest in the foregoing passage
lies in this: that on the very same page, with the few
clear simple words which tell for the first time of Harvey's
facts and proofs, he has briefly written down conjectures
as to the meaning of the circulation. These are
as strikingly put as certain jottings are obscure which
deal on a neighboring page with some possible meanings
of the heart-beat.<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> In neither group of conjectures
do the functions of the lungs play a part; but the discoverer
asks himself whether it be not to revisit the
heat of the heart that the whole mass of the blood
circles back to the chest in its Harveian course! More
than thirty-two years after the date of Harvey's note-book
Harvey wrote to Riolanus:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"There are some who consider that as no impulsion of nutriment
is required for the nutrition of plants, their particles attracting
little by little whatever they need to replace what they have
lost, so in animals there is no need of any impulsion, the vegetative
faculty in both working alike. But there is a difference. In
animals a perpetual flow of warmth is required to cherish the members,
to keep them alive by the aid of vivifying heat, and to restore
parts injured from without. It is not merely nutrition that needs
to be provided for."<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>In the first Exercise to Riolanus Harvey had touched
also upon the use of the circulation, interweaving this
doctrine of heat with the doctrine of respiration as he
then held it, in a passage the last part of which I have
quoted already. Quoted more fully he says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"And this, indeed, is the principal use and end of the circulation,
for which the blood revolves with perpetual influence in its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
ceaseless course and is driven along its circuit: namely, that all
the parts in dependence upon the blood may be kept alive by the
primary innate heat and in their state of vital and vegetative being,
and may perform all their functions; whilst, to use the language
of physiologists, they are sustained and actuated by the inflowing
heat and vital spirits. Thus by the aid of two extremes, viz.:
cold and heat, is the temperature of the animal body retained at
its mean. For as the air inspired tempers the too great heat of
the blood in the lungs and center of the body and effects the expulsion
of suffocating fumes, so in its turn does the hot blood, thrown
through the arteries into the entire body, cherish and nourish and
keep alive all the extremities, preventing extinction due to the
power of external cold."<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>"The innate fire is not in the right ventricle," a Hippocratic
author had written, who had written also that
the wall of the left ventricle is dense, to guard the
strength of the heat.<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> Aristotle, too, had placed in the
heart the "origin" of the "natural innate heat";<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a>
had likened the heart to "the hearth on which shall lie
the natural kindling, well protected also, as being the
acropolis of the body."<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> At a later day Galen had
affirmed the same doctrine.<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a></p>

<p>Let us turn now to the famous treatise of 1628, published
twelve years after the note-book had been
written. In the chapter in which Harvey says "I
tremble lest I have mankind at large for my enemies"
and then publishes and names the circulation,&mdash;in
this chapter, before passing to his proofs, he published
the following words which resound in a way very different
from the simplicity of the note-book:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"So probably it may come to pass in the body through the
movement of the blood that all the parts are nourished, cherished,
quickened, by the hotter, perfected, vaporous, spirituous, and, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
to speak, alimentive blood; that the blood, on the other hand, is
cooled, coagulated, and rendered, as it were, effete in the parts;
whence it returns to its origin, namely, the heart, as to its fountain,
or the hearth of the body, to regain perfection. There by the
potent and fervid natural heat, a treasury of life, as it were, the
blood is liquefied anew and becomes pregnant with spirits and, so
to speak, with balsam. Thence the blood is distributed again;
and all this depends upon the motion and pulsation of the heart.</p>

<p>"The heart, therefore, is the origin of life and the sun of the
microcosm, even as the sun in his turn might well be called the
heart of the world; by the vigor and pulsation of the heart the blood
is moved, perfected, quickened, and delivered from corruption and
thickening; and the function of nourishing, cherishing, quickening
the entire body is performed by that intimate hearth, the heart, the
foundation of life, the author of all. But of these matters more
conveniently when I shall speculate as to the final cause of motion
such as this."<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Upon this florid passage follow the classic six chapters
which bring forward with such power and calm the
proofs of the circulation. These are succeeded in their
turn by words which echo their sobriety, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It will not be beside the question to show also from certain
familiar reasonings, that the circulation is both convenient and
necessary. In the first place, since death is corruption from deficiency
of heat<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> and since all living things are warm, all dying
things cold, the heat requires a seat and origin, a home and hearth,
as it were, in which the tinder of nature, the first beginning of
the innate fire, may be contained and preserved; a place from
which, as from their origin, heat and life may flow out into all the
parts, whence nutriment may come and upon which concoction
and nutrition and all quickening may depend. That this place is
the heart, that this is the origin of life as aforesaid, I should hope
that none would doubt.</p>

<p>"Hence the blood has need of motion, of motion such that it
may return to the heart; for, if sent to the outer parts of the body,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
far from its source,<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> and left unmoved, it would become coagulated.
Heat and spirits are seen to be generated and preserved in all by
motion, to vanish if quiet supervene. Therefore, the blood, thickened
or stiffened by the cold of the extremities and of the ambient
[air] and destitute of spirits, as in the dead, must needs return to its
source and origin in order to keep itself whole, to seek thence and
repair again its heat and spirits."...<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></p>

<p>"Moreover," Harvey says, a page farther on, "since all animals
live by nutriment concocted in their interior, it is necessary that
the concoction and distribution thereof be perfect; and, further,
that a place and receptacle exist where the nutriment may be perfected
and whence it may be led off to the several members. Now
this place is the heart, for it alone of all the parts contains blood
for the public use in its cavities, the auricles and ventricles, as in
cisterns and storehouse; not merely blood for its private use in the
coronary vein and artery."<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>In the next chapter we obtain glimpses of the pathological
relations of this physiology. Harvey brings
forward tertian fever as a case in point, explaining
that the febrile paroxysm is produced when</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"the preternatural heat which has been kindled in the heart is diffused
throughout the entire body by way of the arteries, together
with the morbific matter which thus is evaporated and dissolved
by nature."<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>As a student of the Greek science reads the foregoing
passages, he clearly sees that the new wine of the circulating
blood is poured into the old bottles of the
Aristotelian physiology; and Harvey tells us so himself,
in the last chapter of his most famous treatise.
He says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"No less should we agree with Aristotle as to the sovereignty
of the heart, in dealing with the following and similar questions:
Does it receive motion and sensation from the brain, blood from
the liver; or is it the origin of the veins and of the blood? For<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
they who try to refute him leave out, or do not grasp, the main
argument, which is that the heart is the first part to exist and has in
it blood, life, sensation, motion, before the brain or the liver has
been made or is clearly to be distinguished, or at least before either
can perform any function. So the heart with its own proper organs
constructed for motion&mdash;as it were, an internal animal&mdash;is
the earlier formed; and, this being the first made part, it is the
will of nature that thereafter the entire animal be made, nourished,
preserved, perfected by the heart to be its achievement and abode.
The heart is governor everywhere, like the chief in a commonwealth
with whom is lodged the first and highest authority. In an
animal all power is derived from and depends upon the heart as its
origin and foundation."<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The main argument, which is that the heart is the
first part to exist, is simply the argument from the
development of the embryo in the hen's egg. The
study of this development day by day had been recommended
by one of the Hippocratic writers,<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> and
Aristotle had laid stress upon the changes in the embryo
during incubation.<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> Harvey, in his turn, had studied
them carefully. The ancients could have made their
observations only with the naked eye, but Harvey had
the aid of a simple lens, though of nothing approaching
in power to a microscope.<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> In the treatise of 1628
he speaks as follows of what he thus observed:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"If you turn to the formation of the chick in the egg, the first
thing to exist therein, as I have said, is a mere vesicle, or auricle,
or pulsating drop of blood. Afterward, when growth has gone on,
the heart is completed.... In a hen's egg after four or five days
of incubation I have shown the visible presence of the rudiment of
the chick in the form of a little cloud; in an egg, that is, which had
been immersed in clear tepid water after removal of the shell. In
the middle of the aforesaid little cloud there was a palpitating
bloody point, so fine that in contracting it disappeared and became
invisible, but reappeared on its relaxation, looking like the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
point of a needle, and of a ruddy color; so that being now visible
and now invisible, as though now existent and now non-existent,
it evinced palpitation and the beginning of life."<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>In the same treatise Harvey promises to publish more
observations</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"on the formation of the f&oelig;tus, where numerous problems of the
following order can find a place: Why should this point be made
or perfected earlier, that later? As regards the dominance of the
members: Which part is the cause of the other? There are very
many problems connected with the heart, such as: Why should it
be the first thing (as Aristotle says in his third book on the parts of
animals)<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> to acquire consistency, and be seen possessed of life,
motion, and sensation, before anything has been perfected in the
rest of the body? And in like manner regarding the blood: Why
is it before all, and how possessed of the beginnings<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> of life and of
the animal, and of the craving to move and be impelled hither and
thither, to which end the heart would seem to have been made?"<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>In Harvey's celebrated treatise, despite various
frank questionings by the way, such as that just quoted
about the blood, he so frankly follows in the footsteps
of "the master of them that know" that Aristotle
need not be cited at length to prove the fact. To
Aristotle are largely due Harvey's references to the
heart as the central source of indispensable vital heat;
his references to aliment perfected in the heart; his
blending of psychological doctrines with the doctrine
of the movement of the blood. Therefore, a brief account
of how this became possible will be germane.</p>

<p>When an ancient observer looked with the naked eye
at the very early embryo of the fowl, he distinguished
at first only a blood-red point, which pulsated, or
"leapt." This Aristotle judged to be the heart, containing
blood before any blood-vessel had shown itself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
and before blood was visible in any other part. Very
soon, however, two vessels containing blood were seen,
according to him, to extend from the rudimentary heart
toward the periphery. From these and other considerations
Aristotle inferred that both the blood and all
its containing vessels owe their first origin to the heart;
and that throughout life the liquid made elsewhere
from the food enters the heart, there to be perfected
into blood by the action of the vital innate heat, of
which, as we have seen, he held the fiery central hearth
to be within the heart. Naturally, therefore, he believed
the blood not to be hot of itself, but to acquire its
vivifying heat at the heart, the pulsation of which he
held to be caused directly by the seething of the blood
within. When thus perfected and charged with heat
the blood, according to him, is distributed from the
heart through the vena cava as well as the aorta.
These great vessels and their subdivisions Aristotle
distinguished anatomically; but he made no serious
physiological distinction between what we call the
veins and the arteries, and, himself, applied the word
"artery" to the windpipe only. As to the cavities
and contents of the heart, even as to the number of
its cavities, he had obscure, complex, and erroneous
ideas, and of the valves he knew nothing. He recognized
no essential differences between the matters distributed
by way of the vena cava and by way of the
aorta, all being, alike, one thing, blood; though the
blood was hotter or cooler, thinner or thicker, purer or
cruder, in different regions or parts of the body, in different
sets of vessels, in different cavities of the heart,
or at different times in the same place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>We have seen already that, in the genuine works of
Aristotle, there is no sign that what we call the tissues
of the adult require or receive a derivative of the air,
whether crudely mingled with the blood in the earlier
Hippocratic way, or separate in Erasistratean fashion,
or in the form of such "spirituous blood" as Galen
afterward accepted. We have seen that the air which
Aristotle believed to enter the heart for cooling purposes,
cannot be traced beyond it; that whatever spirits
may exist in the body for him, would seem to be either
of the nature of vapor produced within the body itself,
or of a nature quite indeterminate.<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></p>

<p>The living egg of the hen has had a vast deal to do
with the history of psychology as well as of physiology.
It is partly owing to what Aristotle believed to go on
in the egg that we speak to-day of good hearts and bad
hearts&mdash;even of sweethearts. Aristotle knew nothing
of the nerves, and, therefore, could reasonably fail to
find conclusive evidence that the brain and spinal cord
had to do with what we call nervous functions. So he
fell back upon a doctrine at least as old as the Iliad,<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a>
and made a psychological center of the heart. This
being proved, for Aristotle, largely by its demeanor in
the early embryo, to be the life-long source of the
nutritive blood; and being, for him, the central hearth
of the heat by means of which the blood is perfected and
warmed; he held it a matter of necessity that in the
heart should dwell the so-called "nutritive soul";
that is, the faculty which uses as its most immediate
instrument the "innate," "natural," "vital," "psychical,"
heat, to bring about nutrition, growth, and generation.
He says:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It is impossible that the other faculties of the soul should exist
without the nutritive, or these without the natural fire; for in this
has nature set that faculty aglow."<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Dealing with these other faculties, he sees that there
must be an organ where the results of sight, hearing,
and the other senses, are compared; and deliberately
discussing and rejecting the claims made for the brain
he makes the heart this "common sense-organ of all the
sense-organs," as he styles it. He says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"If in all the creatures the seat of life is in this part, it is clear
that here also must the origin of sensation be; for we say that the
body has life because it is an animal, but we say that it is animal
because it has sensation."<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="noind">Less hollow rings the argument in the modern ear,
when the ancient thinker bases it on conclusions drawn
from observation. We learn from him that only those
parts are sensitive which contain blood, as opposed
to hair and nails, or even to the blood, if taken by itself.
We learn, therefore, that as the heart of the embryo
is the first part to contain blood, it is the first part to be
sensitive and hence is the central source of sensation.
Moreover, Aristotle, like Plato,<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> knowing nothing
of the nerves, judges the blood-vessels to be sensory
paths; and blood-vessels connect, not only the sensitive
flesh, but all the more special sense-organs with
the heart. Such is the outline of the reasons why
Aristotle held the heart to be the lifelong seat, not only
of the "nutritive soul," but of the "sensory soul" as
well.</p>

<p>Pain, pleasure, and desire would naturally dwell
beside sensation in the heart, which Aristotle held to be
obviously the seat of the emotions, as proved by its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
palpitation when they are stirred. Moreover, it is
desire, seated in the heart, which incites to action, to
motion, movement thus resulting from sensation; and,
in general, "the movements" of every sense both begin
and end at the heart; the word here translated "movement"<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a>
being used, in the technical diction of Aristotle,
to include not only the "molar motion" of modern parlance,
but also subtle forms of change of state. Further,
in the early embryo the heart itself is plainly the first
part which possesses motion; it visibly taking the
lead in this, moving "as though itself an animal."
The pulsating movements of the heart are the direct
effects of the seething and vaporization within it;
while, in the respiratory movements, the chest wall
is pushed out by an expansion due to the vital heat,
whose cardiac hearth the lungs inclose, and then
follows inward a contraction due to the cooling air
which has been drawn into the expanding lungs. As
the bodily movements, in general, are "brought about
by drawing and slackening" and originate at the heart,
it is appropriate that the heart contains tendinous
structures<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> within itself; "for it needs the service
and strength" of such.<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> It is too, in a sense, the
origin of the discontinuous tendinous and ligamentous
structures of the body. Aristotle's doctrine of the
heart as the source of motion seems especially vague.
But, hardy thinker though he was, he scarcely could be
definite on this subject, even in speculation. He knew
that heat expands and cold contracts; he recognized
the force which, as he believed, confined or compressed
vapor exerts in living bodies, not only in health but in
disease; and he knew the strength imparted to bodily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
effort by holding the breath. His genuine writings,
however, bring forward no <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">modus operandi</i>, except in
the case of respiration and of the movements of the
heart itself. We are given no inkling as to how the
tendons are normally drawn and slackened in obedience
to the will, for the true function of muscle was unknown
to Aristotle (Harvey to the contrary notwithstanding),<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a>
and the blood-vessels were the only continuous special
paths between center and periphery which Aristotle
could make out. In his time, as we have seen, the
nerves had not been distinguished, even anatomically,
from the bands and cords of the ligaments and tendons.</p>

<p>So, for Aristotle, the nutritive, sensory, and motor
faculties, the desires and emotions, in short all the
souls or parts of the soul (to use the ancient phraseology)
that are not the most exalted, dwell in fire within the
heart, suitably and honorably placed at the central
"acropolis." To the divine mind of man, on the other
hand, he does not assign a definite special dwelling-place
within the body.</p>

<p>Harvey differed often and widely from Aristotle.
Yet even in his old age he wrote: "The authority
of Aristotle has always such weight with me that I
never think of differing from him inconsiderately."<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a>
Cannot one fancy, may not one conjecture, that in the
eyes of the discoverer of the circulation his great discovery,
fundamental, new, and original, as he rightly
claimed it to be, may at times have seemed to constitute
a thorough correcting and filling in of a rough
sketch dashed off at the Lyceum? Let us see.</p>

<p>Aristotle had no conception of anything resembling a
circulation of the blood, nor any definite mechanical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
ideas as to its movement. While the vena cava as well
as the aorta received blood from his valveless heart
and yielded it to the body at large, blood ebbed back
to the heart during sleep, and the warm nutrient liquid
which the vena cava and the aorta yielded to the tissues
had previously entered the heart continuously but in an
imperfect state through both of these great vessels,
to go forth again through both, perfected into blood and
heated, with no perplexing differences of color noted
between that in the great vein and that in the aorta.
The relations between the food, the blood, the heart,
and the body at large, though recognized to be complex,
may well have presented themselves to Aristotle with
something of the vagueness with which the relations
between the food, the liquids, the contractile vacuole,
and the living substance of a protozoön, present themselves
to us. If the heart, retaining its Aristotelian
powers, were found to receive the blood imperfect or
impaired, but to receive it by the veins only, and to
send it out, but only by the arteries, warmed and perfected
or restored to perfection at its Aristotelian source;
what have we but the systemic part of the circulation,
as it may have pictured itself sometimes to Harvey?<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3>PHYSICIANS <i>versus</i> PHILOSOPHERS&mdash;HARVEY FOR THE
PHILOSOPHERS</h3>


<p>Thus it is striking to find Harvey, as the champion
against Galen of a view essentially Aristotelian, entering
the field of controversy where ancient Greek still met
ancient Greek in the modern Europe of 1628.</p>

<p>The discoveries of the nerves and the valves of the
heart had made great difficulties for the Aristotelian
psychology and physiology shortly after Aristotle's
time. We have seen that the semilunar valves were
described, and their use noted, in a treatise included in
the Hippocratic collection;<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> and all the valves, both
arterial and auriculo-ventricular, were well recognized
by Erasistratus, whose acquaintance we have made
already, and who flourished about 300 <small>B.C.</small>, Aristotle
having died in 322 <small>B.C.</small> Erasistratus, we remember,
was more than four centuries earlier than Galen and
more than nineteen centuries earlier than Harvey.</p>

<p>That the heart throughout life is not only the source
of the perfected blood, but gives out blood to the vena
cava for distribution, had been rendered a hard saying,
especially by the recognition of the tricuspid valve.<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a>
Galen, however, like the somewhat earlier Greek
physician Aretæus, the Cappadocian,<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> was not confronted
by this difficulty, for they both adhered to an
ancient doctrine to be found in the Hippocratic treatise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
"On Nourishment," and there sketched with mingled
clearness and vagueness in the following pithy saying:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Root of the veins, the liver; root of the arteries, the heart.
Out of these wander into all parts blood and spirits, and through
these heat comes in."<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="noind">Obviously the doctrine here foreshadowed was quite
irreconcilable with the views of Aristotle.</p>

<p>In studying the works of Harvey and of his contemporaries
and predecessors it must be borne in mind that,
from ancient times past the time of Harvey to more
modern days, the word "heart" was very commonly
used by physicians and men of science to mean simply
the ventricular mass, without the auricles, which were
reckoned in with the great vessels. In slaughterhouses
the word is still used in this ancient sense.
Harvey's practice was fluctuating; for the word is
used by him sometimes to mean the ventricular mass
only, sometimes, as in the science of to-day, to mean
the ventricular mass and the auricles taken together.</p>

<p>According to the more detailed views of Galen and
his school the blood was perfected and had its central
source not in the heart, but in the liver, to which the
portal vein brought a cruder liquid derived from the
products of digestion. In the liver the veins also
originated, while the arteries originated at the heart.
The blood left its source in the liver, by way of the
roots of the venous system, that is, by the hepatic
veins of modern anatomy. From these it entered the
great venous trunk, the vena cava, a vessel which
comprised the inferior cava, the right auricle, and the
superior cava of our present nomenclature. Upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
leaving the liver the blood at once divided into two
sharply diverging streams, one flowing directly downward
through the vena cava, the belly, and the lower
extremities; the other stream flowing directly upward
through the vena cava to the chest, the upper extremities,
and the head. Therefore, that part of the vena
cava which we call the right auricle simply formed a
part of the upward pathway of the blood, at a place
where some of the blood left this upward pathway and
flowed through a side opening into the right ventricle.
This ventricle, therefore, received only a fraction of that
portion of the blood which ascended from the liver.
The rest of the ascending blood mounted in the vena
cava past the right opening which led into the ventricle
and, having traversed thus what we call the right
auricle, entered and traversed what we call the superior
vena cava, to be distributed to the veins and tissues
of the arms and head. Of the fraction of the blood
that entered the right ventricle a part went to the lungs
simply for their nutrition, by the "arterial vein"&mdash;the
pulmonary artery of modern parlance&mdash;and a part
percolated in a refined condition through pores of the
septum from the right ventricle to the left, to be worked
up there with the vital spirits and thus become the
basis of the spirituous blood of the arteries. From the
left ventricle this spirituous blood went to the body
at large by way of the arteries. There is no evidence
that Galen believed any blood to pass from the right
to the left ventricle otherwise than through the pores
of the septum. As he says, however, that the branches
of the "venous artery" (our pulmonary vein) "transmit
thin and pure and vaporous blood in abundance" to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
the lungs for their nutrition,<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> we may infer that he held
this supply to be derived from the left ventricle like
that of the rest of the body. This was possible, according
to Galen's system, because he held to the irrational
opinion that what is now called the mitral valve closed
less perfectly than the other valves, inasmuch as it
possessed only two segments instead of three.</p>

<p>This supposed imperfection of the mitral valve
played an important part in Galen's system, for it was
possible thereby for the lung to receive, not only some
spirituous blood from the left ventricle of the heart, but
also, and especially, the injurious fumes which Galen
held to arise from combustion in the left ventricle, to
escape into the venous artery past the imperfect mitral
valve, and to be exhaled in expiration. When this
valvular door was open, therefore, the left ventricle
drew from the lungs into itself crude spirits, these to
be returned in some part perhaps to the lungs as spirituous
blood in company with the deleterious fumes, when
the valvular door was only ajar. This imperfection of
the valve of two segments, however, was but a constant
and fortunate exaggeration of a condition shared to a
slight degree by all the valves; for Galen held these, in
the act of closing, to allow slight regurgitation of spirits,
vapor, or even of blood; and to do so exceptionally even
when closed, if the movement of the heart were of
unusual force. He commonly, however, assumed the
tricuspid, pulmonary, and aortic valves to be competent,
especially if he could gain a polemical point by
doing so.<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a></p>

<p>More than thirteen centuries later Columbus, as we
have learned, announced that blood from the right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
ventricle entered the left ventricle, not by pores of the
septum, but exclusively by pores of the lungs, in passing
through which latter it became spirituous blood, needing
but little elaboration in the ventricle before entering the
arteries for distribution to the body. Columbus denied
and derided the passage of fumes from the left ventricle
to the lungs, while he accepted the ancient doctrine of
the cooling effect of respiration. His view of the meaning
of the pulmonary transit is therefore a striking
approximation to the truth&mdash;a closer one than that of
Harvey, who questioned everything except the fumes
given off in expiration, which fumes, of course, Harvey
did not send along the Galenic path. As Columbus
declared the spirituous blood to be made up in the
lungs, and these, therefore, to need no supply thereof
from the left ventricle; and as he also denied the
passage of fumes through the venous artery; the
flow through the latter became simplified, spirituous
blood alone passing through it, and in the true
direction from the lungs to the heart. Accordingly
the mitral valve also was cured of its Galenic imperfection;
to the latter Columbus does not even
refer, but he simply describes all the four valves as
competent.</p>

<p>Columbus, therefore, set forth the true course, and in
no small degree the true nature and meaning, of the
movement whereby blood passes from the right auriculo-ventricular
ring to the aorta, and in so doing he
expelled important errors from the Galenic system.
But, strange to say, by thus purging it he greatly
strengthened it, as was mentioned earlier in this paper,
for he harmonized the fundamental doctrine of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
Galenic system with the true mechanism and working
of the cardiac valves, and with a rational theory of
respiration.<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> This fundamental Galenic doctrine was
the direct distribution of blood to the tissues through
the veins from the liver as a center; no more than a
fraction of the blood ever passing the tricuspid valve
to reach the lungs or to enter the arteries as spirituous
blood. Of this doctrine Columbus was not only an
adherent, but a warm partisan against the Aristotelians;
and, like Galen more than thirteen centuries
before, Columbus points with emphasis to the tricuspid
valve as evidence of the falsity of the Aristotelian doctrine
that crude blood enters the heart to be perfected
and returned thence to the vena cava for distribution.<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a>
The Galenic view that the liver is the origin of the veins
and the source of the blood, by which word, unqualified,
was meant the venous blood, was known even down to
Harvey's day as the view of "the physicians," as opposed
to that of "the philosophers," who contended
in ingenious ways for the view of the great philosopher
Aristotle that the heart is the origin of the veins and the
source of the blood. Harvey in this contest repeatedly
ranges himself in his writings with the Aristotelians and
against the Galenists;<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> we shall see him bring the
circulation into play to give very effective aid to the
former against Galen himself.</p>

<p>Bearing in mind the Galenic meaning of the word
"blood," and remembering that, in spite of the weak
points in Galen's own armor, he possessed in the tricuspid
valve a formidable weapon against the followers
of Aristotle, listen to the following passage from Harvey's
treatise of 1628. He says:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Whether or no the heart imparts anything more to the blood
than transposition, locomotion, and distribution, whether it imparts
heat also, or spirits, or perfection, must be looked into later
and gathered from other observations. For the present be it enough
to have shown sufficiently that during the beat of the heart the
blood is transfused and withdrawn from the veins into the arteries
through the ventricles of the heart, and is distributed to the body
at large.</p>

<p>"This, to be sure, is conceded by all after a fashion, it being
gathered from the structure of the heart and the arrangement,
position, and use of the valves. But they seem to waver blindly as
though in a dark place, and they put together varied, incoherent,
and more or less contradictory doctrines and, indeed, set forth much
upon conjecture, as has been shown already.</p>

<p>"There seems to me to have been one single principal cause of
hesitation and error in this matter, viz.: the connection between
the heart and the lung in man. The disappearance of the arterial
vein in the lungs having been noted, and likewise that of the venous
artery, great obscurity prevailed as to whence or how the right
ventricle distributed the blood to the body, or the left ventricle
drew blood from the vena cava. This is attested by the words of
Galen when he inveighs against Erasistratus regarding the origin
and use of the veins and the coction of the blood. 'You will answer,'
Galen says, 'that the way of it is this: that the blood is
prepared beforehand in the liver and is transferred thence to the
heart to receive the rest of its proper character in complete perfection.
Surely this does not seem devoid of reason; for no great and
perfect work can be accomplished suddenly at one attempt and
receive its entire polish from a single instrument. If then this be
so, show us another vessel which leads the completely perfected
blood forth from the heart, and distributes it to the whole body as
the artery does the spirits.'<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> Behold Galen disapproving and
putting aside a reasonable opinion because, besides not seeing the
path of transit,<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> he cannot find a vessel to distribute the blood
from the heart to the whole body!</p>

<p>"But had there been anyone on the spot to take the part of
Erasistratus or of that opinion which is now our own and is confessed
by Galen himself to be reasonable in other respects; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
had the person aforesaid pointed his finger at the great artery
[aorta] as the distributer of the blood from the heart to the body
at large,&mdash;I wonder what answer that divine man would have
made, full of genius and of learning as he was! Had he said that
the artery distributed spirits and not blood, he certainly would
sufficiently have refuted Erasistratus, who believed that only spirits
were contained in the arteries; but in so doing Galen would have
contradicted himself and would shamefully have denied what he
sharply contends to be true in a special book<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> which he wrote
against that same Erasistratus. For he proves by many powerful
arguments, and demonstrates by experiments, that blood, and not
spirits, is naturally contained in the arteries.</p>

<p>"But since the divine man concedes, as he often does in that
same place, 'that all the arteries of the body arise from the great
artery, and this from the heart; and that for a certainty blood is
naturally contained and borne onward in all of them,' he maintaining
'that the three sigmoid valves placed at the orifice of the aorta
forbid the return of blood into the heart, and that nature would
never have set these valves in apposition to the most preëminent of
the viscera were the valves not to do it some most important
service;'&mdash;since, I say, the father of physicians concedes all this
and in these very words, as he does in the book aforesaid, I do not
see how he can deny that the great artery is the vessel adapted to
distribute the blood, now arrived at complete perfection, from the
heart to the body at large."<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Thus does the great English discoverer bring the pulmonary
transit and the circulation of the blood to the
rescue of the Aristotelian heart, despite Galen and the
tricuspid valve! Between Harvey and the school
that refused to the heart more than a fraction of the
blood, there could be no peace. It is the Galenists
whose system he attacked and shattered so thoroughly;
and those who long and bitterly opposed the acceptance
of the Harveian circulation were of the Galenic school.
In a private letter written twenty-three years after the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
publication of his discovery, Harvey excuses the
French physician Riolanus for having slighted the circulation
not long before, saying, among other things:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It was proper that the dean of the College of Paris should
keep the medicine of Galen in repair; and should admit no novelties
into his school without the utmost winnowing."<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a></p></blockquote>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3>THE CIRCULATION AND THE PRIMACY OF THE BLOOD</h3>


<p>We have found the discoverer of the circulation an
admirer and defender of Aristotle; but we shall leave
him far less Aristotelian than we found him. Before
he died, he had transferred to the blood itself that
physiological primacy which Aristotle had given to the
heart; Harvey having come to regard the blood even
as the very seat of the soul, harking back to a Greek
doctrine older than Aristotle and expressly discountenanced
by him.<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> This final view of Harvey was
not simply an outcome of his old age, though he develops
and formally declares and insists upon the doctrine
of the primacy of the blood in the writings which
he published when beyond the age of seventy, more
than twenty years after the publication of his treatise
of 1628. We have seen that in this his most famous
work he adheres impressively to the Aristotelian doctrine
of the primacy of the heart; though even this
work contains utterances of Harvey which do not well
accord with that doctrine. More than eleven years
earlier, when making notes for his lectures of 1616, he
asked himself in striking terms, whether the circulation
do not exist in order that the blood may be heated by
the heart.<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> Yet there are passages in those very same
notes which show that, beside vaguer conjectures,<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a>
the doctrine of the primacy of the blood was present
clearly to Harvey's mind even so early as in his thirty-seventh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
year. In his lecture notes four passages are
especially significant as to this doctrine. Of these the
first is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Yf I could shew what I hav seene, y^t weare att an end between
physicians et philosophers."</p></blockquote>

<p class="noind">After these words in English Harvey falls into his usual
Latin, which may be translated thus:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"For the blood is rather the author of the viscera than they of
it, because the blood is present before the viscera, nor yet coming
from the mother,<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> for in the egg there is a drop. The soul<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> is
in the blood."<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="noind">In a second passage of his note-book Harvey says,
speaking of the heart:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It is most exceeding full of contained blood, as no other viscus
is. Wherefore Aristotle [holds] against the physicians that the
origin of the blood is not in the liver but in the heart, because in the
liver there is no blood outside the veins. Rather is the blood the
origin of both, as I have seen."<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="noind">In a third passage Harvey says of the heart that its</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"temperature is exceeding hot, inasmuch as it is exceeding full of
blood."<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="noind">In a fourth passage of the lecture notes which bears
upon the primacy of the blood we may read:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"1. [The heart] is the most principal part of all, not because of
itself,<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> for its flesh is more fibrous and harder and colder than the
liver, but because of the abundance of blood and spirits in the
ventricles.</p>

<p>"1. Whence the fount of the entire heat.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"Whence the auricles pulsate, after removal of the heart, because
of the multitudinous blood.<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>"2. Nor is [the heart] the principal part because of its origin:
for I believe that the ventricles (which in the f&oelig;tus are both united
as in fishes) are made out of a drop of blood which is in the egg; and
that the heart, together with the rest [of the parts] all sprout<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a>
simultaneously, as [occurs] in an ear of corn, from an imperceptible
size. Is there only a drop of blood in the auricles whence bestowing
heat upon all parts, receiving from none, it is the citadel and
domicile of the heat, the household shrine<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> of that edifice, fowntayn
conduit hed."<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>More than eleven years after the making of his lecture
notes Harvey, at the age of fifty, published his
treatise of 1628; and later, after keeping silence for
more than twenty years, he published together the
two Exercises addressed to Riolanus. During these
twenty years and more the blood must have been rising
and the heart declining, in Harvey's esteem, as ruling
powers in the body; for at the end of that time more
than thirty-two years after the jotting down of the
statements and varied conjectures of his lecture notes,
he formally throws over Aristotle's primacy of the
heart, in a passage near the close of the second Exercise
to Riolanus. Of this passage the following is a part.
Referring to certain opinions, mainly Aristotelian, regarding
the heart and blood, Harvey says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"To speak openly, I do not believe that those things are so in
the sense commonly received; and my opinion is inclined in the
direction aforesaid by much which is visible in the generation of
the parts, but which is not convenient to set down here. Soon,
perhaps, I shall make public things even more wonderful and destined
to cast even greater light upon natural philosophy.</p>

<p>"For the present I will only say and set forth without demonstration&mdash;by
good leave of the learned and with due respect to the
ancients&mdash;that the heart, as the beginning, author, source, and
origin of everything in the body and the first cause of life, should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
be held to include the veins and all the arteries and also the contained
blood; just as the brain, including all its nerves and sensory
organs and spinal marrow, is the one adequate organ of sensation,
as the phrase is. If by the word 'heart,' however, only the body of
the heart be meant with its ventricles and auricles, I do not believe
that it is the manufacturer of the blood; nor that the blood possesses
vigor, faculty, reason,<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> motion, or heat, as the gift of the
heart."<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>In the second year after that of the Exercises to
Riolanus Harvey's final publication, his treatise On
Generation with appended essays, was given to the
world, not long before his seventy-third birthday.
During how many years this work had been in preparation
we do not know; but it is avowedly based upon the
views of Aristotle, whom Harvey styles his "<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dux</i>"&mdash;his
leader&mdash;as regards the subject of this treatise.<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a>
In it, to be sure, the ancient master is often weighed in
the balance and found wanting by Harvey, who even
questions whether Aristotle had seen for himself what
he "narrates as to the generation of the chick," or "had
accepted it from some expert."<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> Nevertheless, it is
with the doctrines of Aristotle that Harvey incessantly
compares the results of observation. Here the
veteran records anew his denial of the Aristotelian
primacy of the heart, and records as well his final
emphatic assertion of the primacy of the blood. In
regard to these matters it is interesting to note the
various grades of expression which appear to mirror
in this single work the various phases of Harvey's
thought.</p>

<p>In the following florid passage doubt of the primacy
of the heart seems hardly even hinted at. Harvey
says:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Certain of the parts themselves are said to be generative, such
as the heart, from which Aristotle declares that the rest of the
parts derive their origin; as is also clear from the history which
I have given. The heart, I say&mdash;or at least its first beginning, to
wit, the vesicle and leaping point&mdash;constructs the rest of the body
to be its future abode; enters this when once built up, and hides
in it, vivifies and governs it; fortifies it with ribs and sternum super-imposed
as a bulwark; and is a kind of household shrine, as it were,
the first seat of the soul, the first receptacle and perennial soul-endowed<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a>
hearth of the innate heat, the source and origin of all
the faculties, and their sole relief in calamity."<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Divergence from Aristotle in the matter of the heart
is plainly marked, however, in the following passage
of the same treatise, where Harvey says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"We find the blood formed before anything else in the egg and in
the product of conception;<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> and almost at the same time the receptacles
of the blood, the veins and the pulsating vesicle, become
plainly visible. Wherefore, if the leaping point together with
the veins and blood, which are all conspicuous as one single organ
at the first beginning of the embryo, be accepted as the heart (the
parenchyma of which is superadded to the vesicle later in the formation
of the embryo), it is manifest that, accepted in this sense,
that is, as an organ composed of parenchyma, ventricles, auricles,
and blood, the heart in animals is in very truth, as Aristotle would
have it, the principal and first generated part of the body; of which
part, however, the first and foremost part is the blood, both by
nature and in the order of generation."<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>In the following third passage of the same treatise no
reconciling interpretations of the master's words are
to be found; flat disagreement with Aristotle is declared;
and the "Sun of the Microcosm"<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> declines
nearly to its simple modern status of a living pump!
Harvey says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Nor can I agree with Aristotle himself, who maintained that the
heart is the primary generative part and that it is endowed with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
soul; for, truly, I believe the blood alone to be entitled to these
distinctions, since the blood it is which first appears in generation;
and that such is the case not only in the egg but also in every f&oelig;tus
and very early animal embryo, shall at once be made plain.<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a></p>

<p>"At the beginning, I say, there appear the red leaping point,
the pulsating vesicle, and filaments, derived thence, which contain
blood in their interior. And, so far as can be discerned by accurate
inspection, the blood is made before the leaping point is formed,
and the blood is endowed with vital heat before it is set in motion
by pulsation; and, further, as pulsation is begun in and by the
blood, so at last it ends in the blood at the final instant of death.
Indeed, by numerous experiments done upon the egg and otherwise
I have made sure that it is the blood in which the power of returning
to life persists, so long as the vital heat has not wholly vanished.
And since the pulsating vesicle and the sanguineous filaments
derived from it are seen before anything else, it stands to reason
in my belief that the blood is prior to its receptacles&mdash;the contained,
that is, to its container&mdash;since the latter is made for the
use of the former. Therefore, it is probable that the filaments and
the veins and then the vesicle and at length the heart, having
organs destined to receive and retain the blood, are made for the
sole purpose of transmitting and distributing it, and that the blood
is the principal part of the body....</p>

<p>"Therefore, relying with certainty upon what I have observed
in the egg and in the dissection of living animals, I maintain against
Aristotle that the blood is the primary generative part; and that
the heart is its organ, destined to send it on a circuit. Surely the
function of the heart is the propulsion of the blood, as is admirably
clear in all animals that have blood; and in the generation of
the chick the same duty falls to the pulsating vesicle, which in the
very early embryos of animals<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> no less than in the egg I have
often exhibited to view as something more minute than a spark,
beating and when in action contracting itself and at the same time
pressing out the blood contained in it, and in its relaxation receiving
the same afresh."<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Whether in studying the foregoing passages we read
Harvey's earlier jottings in his private note-book or the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
deliberate statements published in his old age, it is
evident that to his mind the question of the primacy
of the blood versus the primacy of the heart depends
for answer upon the further question whether in the
development of the embryo the blood be made before
the heart, or the heart before the blood. In no other
part than one of these two can the primacy inhere, for
him; and whichever of these two has the priority
must be, to Harvey's mind, the origin of the other and
of the remaining parts and must continue to be the
"principal part" of the body throughout life. The
matter of the primacy thus resolves itself into one of
well-devised and accurate observation; and the discoverer
is once more upon the ground where his undying
laurels grew. He, therefore, deals no longer "without
demonstration," as in the second Exercise to Riolanus,
but makes report of actual observations and so gives
ocular evidence in support of his views, remembering,
it may be, that he had said to Riolanus: "Soon, perhaps,
I shall make public things even more wonderful
and destined to cast even greater light on natural
philosophy."<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> Harvey's contemporary Milton said
to Parliament: "Truth is compar'd in Scripture to a
streaming fountain; if her waters flow not in a perpetuall
progression, they sick'n into a muddy pool of
conformity and tradition."<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> These words seem timely
as we note the great discoverer, magnifying glass in hand,
searching in incubated eggs for an answer to the question,
now wholly obsolete, whether the primacy of the
heart should not give way to the primacy of the blood.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Surely," says Harvey, "this investigation is one of great
moment, to wit: whether or no the blood be present before the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
pulse; and is the point<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> derived from the veins or the veins from
the point? So far as I have been able to observe, the blood appears
to exist before the pulse; and I will show cause for this opinion
as follows: On a Wednesday evening I put three eggs under a hen;
and having come back on the Saturday, a little before the same hour,
I found these eggs cold as though deserted by the hen. I opened
one of them, nevertheless, and came upon the beginning of a chick,
namely, a red sanguineous line at the circumference,<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> but at the
centre instead of the leaping point a point which was white and
bloodless. By this sign I perceived that the hen had left off sitting
not long before. So I caught her, shut her up in a box, and kept
her there the entire night; that is, after I had put under her the
two remaining eggs together with other fresh ones. What was the
result? Next day in the very early morning both eggs had revived;
and at the centre the beating point itself was visible, much smaller
than the white point; out of which, that is, out of the white one, it
made its appearance in diastole only, like a spark leaping forth
from a cloud: so that the red point seemed to me to flash out of
the white point; the leaping point being generated in the latter,
in one way or another; and the blood to be already in existence,
when the leaping point is brought into existence or at least into
motion. Indeed, I have very often found that even when the
leaping point lies still and devoid of all motion as though quite
dead, it recovers motion and pulsation again if warmed afresh.
From the foregoing I judge that in the order of generation the
point and the blood come into existence first; but that pulsation
does not come on till afterward. Certainly this is settled, viz.:
that of the future embryo nothing at all appears on this day<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a>
except the sanguineous lines and the leaping point and also those
veins which grow all from one trunk (as this grows from the leaping
point) and are dispersed throughout the entire colliquative<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a>
region in very many ramified filaments....</p>

<p>"Toward the end of the fourth day and the beginning of the
fifth the sanguineous point is already increased in size and is seen
to be turned into a small and very delicate vesicle containing blood
within itself; which blood it drives out at every contraction, and
receives afresh when its diastole takes place.</p>

<p>"Up to this stage I have found it impossible to discriminate between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
the vessels; for the arteries are not to be distinguished from
the veins either by their coats or by the pulse; and so I think it
best to style all the vessels, indiscriminately, veins or, with Aristotle,<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a>
venous canals....<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a></p>

<p>"On the sixth day ... the parenchyma of the heart grows on
to the pulsating vesicle; and shortly afterward the rudiments of
the liver and of the lungs are discernible."<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>It is clear that Harvey's hens did not very often take
such well-timed steps against Aristotle; for in another
passage of his treatise on generation, in summing up its
events and their order, he frankly states the difficulties
which render uncertain the question of priority
between the blood and the heart. He speaks of "the
first generated and generative part; that is to say, the
blood together with its receptacles or, if you prefer,
the heart with its veins."<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> A few lines further on he
says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In the generation of this first part (which is accomplished in
the egg on the fourth day) although I have not been able to observe
any order, because all portions of the part aforesaid (namely, the
blood, the veins and the pulsating vesicle) appear at the same time;
nevertheless, my belief would be, as I have said, that the blood is
present before the pulse; and that, therefore, in obedience to a law
of nature the blood is prior to its receptacles, that is, to the veins."<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="noind">In Harvey's first publication, of 1628, we have
read:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"If you turn to the formation of the chick in the egg, the first
thing to exist therein, as I have said, is a mere vesicle, or auricle,
or pulsating drop of blood. Afterward, when growth has gone on,
the heart is completed."<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="noind">In his last publication, of 1651, we have read:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"So far as can be discerned by accurate inspection, the blood
is made before the leaping point is formed, and the blood is endowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
with vital heat before it is set in motion by pulsation; and further,
as pulsation is begun in and by the blood, so at last it ends in the
blood at the final instant of death."<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Harvey's own words in the foregoing two passages
effectively sum up both the nature of his doctrine that
the blood is the first part of the body to live, and the
nature of his evidence. But the words of the second
passage foreshadow a closely related doctrine, advanced
and held by him on the evidence of observation, viz.:
that the blood, being the first part to live, is also the
last part of the body to die. That the first part to
live is always the last to die, is a doctrine set forth
by Aristotle. This, Harvey seems to accept without
question and to apply upon proper evidence to
the blood; as he accepts and warmly upholds the
ancient master's doctrine that there is a primacy of
the body. The results of observation have forced
Harvey to transfer this primacy from the heart to
the blood, but it is the Aristotelian primacy still.
Presently he shall show us that the blood is not only
the first part to live, but the last to die. Before he
does so, however, let Aristotle speak for himself, saying
briefly:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The point<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> of origin [of the rest of the body] is the first thing
generated. The point of origin in the animals which possess blood
is the heart; in the rest, the analogue thereof, as I have often said.
Moreover, the fact that the heart is the first thing generated is evident,
not only to the senses, but from its death.<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> For therein life
ceases the last; and in all cases the last generated is the first to make
an end, the first generated, the last to make an end; nature, as it
were, doubling back and returning upon her point of origin whence
she came.<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> For generation is the change from not being to being;
destruction is the reverse change, from being to not being."<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p class="noind">Aristotle does not tell us why "in all cases ... the
first generated" is "the last to make an end," and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vice
versa</i>. Let it suffice that Harvey accepts this sweeping
doctrine. Now let him complete his evidence in favor
of the primacy of the blood by showing that the blood
is not only the first part to live and to live tenaciously,
but the last part to die.</p>

<p>In a passage of the treatise On the Motion of the
Heart and Blood, we have already read Harvey's
promise to publish observations</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"on the formation of the f&oelig;tus, where numerous problems of the
following order can find a place: Why should this part be made
or perfected earlier, that later? As regards the dominance of the
members: Which part is the cause of the other? There are very
many problems connected with the heart, such as: Why should it
be the first thing (as Aristotle says in his third book On the Parts of
Animals)<a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> to acquire consistency, and be seen possessed of life,
motion, and sensation, before anything has been perfected in the
rest of the body? And in like manner regarding the blood: Why
is it before all, and how possessed of the beginnings<a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> of life and of
the animal, and of the craving to move and be impelled hither and
thither, to which end the heart would seem to have been made?"<a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="noind">That Harvey should have printed this passage in
1628, in the same work with his repeated eulogies of
the Aristotelian heart, shows that the idea of the possible
primacy of the blood must have been in his mind
early. It was, indeed, so from the jotting down of his
private notes of 1616, to the publication of the Exercises
to Riolanus in 1649 and the treatise On Generation in
1651. The same mental attitude is revealed, perhaps
more strongly, in the following passage of an earlier
chapter of Harvey's treatise of 1628. Here we come
upon the thought that it may be the blood, and neither<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
ventricle nor auricle, which is the last to die. Harvey
says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Besides this, however, I have occasionally observed, after the
heart and even its right auricle<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> had ceased their pulsations as
though in the act of dying, that an obscure motion and flow and a
sort of palpitation manifestly remained in the blood itself contained
in the right auricle, so long, that is, as the blood appeared
to be imbued with heat and spirits. Something of the sort is very
plainly to be seen at the beginning of the generation of an animal,
in the hen's egg within the first seven days of incubation. There
is present, first and before all else, a drop of blood which palpitates
(as Aristotle also noted); from which, when growth has taken
place and the chick has been formed to some extent, the auricles
of the heart are made; and in these, which pulsate perpetually,
life inheres....</p>

<p>"Whoever, therefore, shall choose to investigate more closely
will say that the heart is not the first to live and the last to die, but
that the auricles, and the part which answers thereto in serpents,
fishes, and such animals, are alive sooner than the heart itself and
also die later than the heart. Whether even earlier the blood itself,
or the spirit, have not an obscure palpitation of its own, which
it has seemed to me to retain after death, may well be questioned;
and whether we should not speak of life as beginning with palpitation."<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>It is plain that fibrillar contractions of cardiac
muscle misled Harvey into thinking and writing of "an
obscure motion and flow," of "an obscure palpitation,"
of the blood itself within the dying auricle. It is plain
that when he wrote his most famous treatise he was
loath, even under Aristotle's leadership, to reach out so
far beyond the evidence of the senses as to attribute
the palpitation of the visible drop of blood in the very
early embryo to anything but the hot blood itself.
Later, in his treatise On Generation, he published a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
passage which in some ways runs parallel with the
foregoing. In the earlier passage the results of observation
are brought forward as food for thought; in the
later one, as proofs of a theory, fully, clearly, and emphatically
stated by a thinker who is near the end of
life and is imparting his final judgment. This later
passage is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In whatsoever part of the body heat and motion have their
beginning, in that same part life also first arises and therein is
extinguished last; nor may it be doubted that there, too, life has its
innermost home, that there the soul itself has fixed its seat.</p>

<p>"The life then inheres in the blood (as we read also in Holy
Writ<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a>), because therein the life and the soul are manifest first
and fail last. For, as I have said, in the dissection of living animals
I have found repeatedly that, though the animal be dying and
breathe no longer, nevertheless, the heart pulsates for some time and
keeps the life in it. Moreover, when the heart is quieted you may
see movement surviving in the auricles, and latest in the right
auricle; and at length all pulsation ceasing there, you may find
in the blood itself a kind of undulation and obscure agitation or
palpitation, the last indication of life. And anyone can perceive
that the blood retains in itself to the last the heat which is the author
of pulsation and life; if this heat is once wholly extinguished and
the blood now is blood no more, but cruor, so there is left no hope of
a return to life again. Nevertheless, after all pulsation has disappeared,
both in the egg, as I have said, and in dying animals, if you
will make a gentle warm application, in the former case to the leaping
point, in the latter to the right auricle of the heart, you shall see
movement, pulsation, and life, renewed immediately by the blood;
provided it have not utterly lost all its innate heat and vital
spirits."<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>How readily heat from without can revive the cool
leaping point, is strikingly set forth by Harvey in
another chapter of this treatise On Generation. He
says:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Moreover, if an egg be exposed too long to a colder atmosphere,
its leaping point pulsates less often and stirs more languidly;
but if a warm finger be applied to it, or any other bland source of
warmth, straightway it recovers strength and vigor. Indeed, when
such a point has become gradually weak and though full of blood
ceases to move at all and gives no sign of life, seeming utterly to have
succumbed to death, if my lukewarm finger be placed over it for
the space of twenty pulsations of my artery, behold! the little heart
revives once more, becomes erect, and renews its pristine dance as
though come back from Hades. This I myself and others, too, have
brought about again and again by means of gentle warmth of any
kind, such as that of a fire or of tepid water; thus at our pleasure
being able to give over the poor little soul to death, or call it back
to the light."<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="noind">As in the embryo the leaping point may be revived by
external warmth, so may the heart in the full-grown
bird. In his treatise of 1628 Harvey says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In the pigeon, at any rate, at an actual experiment, after the
heart had wholly ceased to move and even the auricles had left off
moving, I placed my finger, wetted with saliva and warm, upon the
heart and kept it there for a while; as the result of which fomentation
the heart, as though restored to strength and life again, and
its auricles with it, were seen to move and contract and relax themselves
and, as it were, to be recalled from death."<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>In his treatise On Generation, Harvey confirms the
doctrine of the primacy of the blood by citing observations
made upon sluggish or hibernating animals and
also certain morbid phenomena in man, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"This, too, clearly follows from many observations; especially
the cases of certain animals which possess blood yet live a long time
without a pulse; and of some which lie hidden the whole winter
and, nevertheless, continue alive, although meanwhile all movement
of the heart has ceased and their lungs enjoy a rest from breathing,
like people who lie half dead and pulseless in syncope or faintness or
hysterical affections."<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>So Harvey convinced himself, by observation, that
the first part of the developing embryo to appear is the
blood of the "sanguineous lines"; after this the blood
which seems to palpitate of itself at the leaping point,
which later develops into a pulsating vesicle wherein
blood is contained within a contractile wall; to this
being superadded still later the contractile parenchyma
of the heart. Also, by observation, he convinced himself
that in a dying animal the blood within the right
auricle may palpitate of itself after the palpitations due
to contractions of the auricular wall have ceased.
Thus was Harvey led to believe that the blood and not
the heart is the first part to live and the last to die, the
principal part of the body, the generator of the heart
and of all the rest. In spite of his appeal to observation,
his impressive primacy of the blood is now as completely
forgotten in its turn as is Aristotle's impressive
primacy of the heart, which Harvey felt called upon to
supersede. Naturally in this matter the great discoverer
used true methods of investigation; and doubtless
his imperfect conclusions were due in large part
to the weakness of his magnifying glasses and to the
deficient technique of his day. Harvey said of himself,
speaking generally, that he trusted much to the
plain use of his senses.<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> That he did so, was well for
him and for all mankind; yet because of this very
trust he did not always escape the pitfalls dug by what
we now call "naked-eye" appearances.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3>THE CAUSE OF THE HEART-BEAT</h3>


<p>The primacy of the blood was no isolated fact for
Harvey, but one linked with the very existence of the circulation.
This primacy depended largely upon the blood
being the primal abode of the innate heat. Palpitation
produced by the innate heat in the blood itself, he held to
be the first sign of life in the embryo and the last sign of
life in the dying creature; and a swelling produced by
the innate heat, he held to take place throughout life,
localized in the blood just outside of the entrance to the
heart. This local swelling of the blood was, to him,
the exciting cause of the heart-beat and, therefore, of
the circulation. We have heard him deny that the
blood possesses motion "as the gift of the heart."<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a>
We can now grasp the probable meaning of this denial.
He would not have been illogical had he said also that
the heart possesses motion as the gift of the blood.
This view of the cause of the heart-beat was first set
forth by Harvey in 1649 in the Exercises to Riolanus,
and in immediate connection with declarations in
favor of the primacy of the blood, which also was first
formally advocated in those Exercises. As we know,
the question of this primacy had given Harvey food
for thought long before. But his view of the cause
of the heart-beat is not to be found in his lecture notes,
nor in the treatise of 1628, and may well have been a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
later outgrowth from the larger doctrine of the primacy
of the blood.</p>

<p>Let us now turn to the Exercises and to Harvey's
own account of the cause of the heart-beat. The first
passage to be quoted begins with a few sentences
which have been introduced previously, but which
form a necessary cue for the statement we are to study.
Harvey says to Riolanus:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"For the present I will only say and set forth without demonstration&mdash;by
good leave of the learned and with due respect to the
ancients&mdash;that the heart, as the beginning, author, source, and
origin of everything in the body and the first cause of life, should
be held to include the veins and all the arteries and also the contained
blood; just as the brain, including all its nerves and sensory
organs and spinal marrow, is the one adequate organ of sensation,
as the phrase is. If by the word 'heart,' however, only the body of
the heart be meant with its ventricles and auricles, I do not believe
that it is the manufacturer of the blood; nor that the blood possesses
vigor, faculty, reason,<a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> motion, or heat, as the gift of the heart.
Moreover, I judge the cause of diastole and expansion not to be the
same as that of systole and contraction, either in the arteries, or
in the auricles or the ventricles of the heart; but that part of the
pulse which is called diastole has another cause, different from the
systole, and always and everywhere must precede every systole;
I judge the first cause of expansion to be the innate heat and expansion
to occur first in the blood itself, gradually thinned and swelling
up like matters in fermentation, and to be extinguished last in the
same; and I accept Aristotle's parallel with pottage or milk with
this proviso, that the rising or falling of the blood is not brought
about by vapors, or exhalations, or spirits, excited into some vaporous
or aërial form, and is caused, not by an external agent, but by an
internal principle, and is regulated by nature.</p>

<p>"Nor is the heart (like a hot kettle), as some imagine, the origin
of the heat and of the blood in the same sense as a hot coal or a fire-place.
The blood rather imparts heat to the heart, as to all other
parts, than receives heat from it, for the blood is, of all things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
within the body, the hottest; and so the heart is provided with
coronary arteries and veins for the same purpose as that of the
arteries and veins of other parts, viz.: to secure an influx of heat
which shall foster and preserve. Hence it is to use convertible
terms to say that all the hotter parts contain more blood and that
the richer they are in blood, the hotter they are. It is in this sense
that the heart, so remarkable for its cavities, should be reckoned
a workshop, source, perpetual fire-place; it is like a hot kettle by
virtue, not of its body, but of its contained blood, in the same sense
in which the liver, the spleen, the lungs, and other parts are reckoned
hot; because they contain many veins or vessels containing
blood. In this way also I maintain that the native heat, or innate
warmth, being the common instrument of all the functions, is likewise
the prime efficient cause of the pulse. This I do not now assert
positively, but only propose as a thesis. Whatever may be brought
forward to the contrary by learned and upright men without scurrilous
language, clamor, or contumely, I shall be glad to know,
and whoever shall do that will earn my gratitude."<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Harvey has thus transferred to the blood the primacy
of the body, making the blood in place of the
Aristotelian heart the primal abode of the innate heat,
"the common instrument of all the functions." Nevertheless,
the blood of the Harveian circulation cannot
perform the duties of the primacy without the aid of
Aristotle.</p>

<p>If we turn from the Exercises to the treatise On
Generation, published about two years later, we find
the author saying:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The primacy of the blood is evident from this also, that the pulse
has its origin in the blood. For since a pulsation consists of two
parts, to wit: an expansion and a contraction, or a diastole and
systole, and since the prior of these movements is the expansion,
it is plain that this action is due to the blood, but that the contraction
is set a-going in the egg by the pulsating vesicle, as by the heart
in the chick, by means of its own fibres as though by an instrument<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
devised for that purpose. It is certain also that the aforesaid vesicle
and, at a later time, the cardiac auricle from which pulsation
starts, is excited by the blood, which expands to the motion which
constricts. The diastole, I say, is produced by the blood which
swells up as if with interior spirits; and so Aristotle's opinion as
to the heart's pulsation&mdash;namely, that it is produced after the
manner of ebullition&mdash;is in some measure true. For the same
thing which we see every day in milk heated over the fire and in
the fermentation of our beer, comes into play also in the pulsation
of the heart, in which the blood swells as from some fermentation,
is expanded, and subsides; and what is brought about in the cases
aforesaid by accident and by an external agent, to wit, by adventitious
heat from somewhere, is effected in the blood by the internal
heat or innate spirits, and is also regulated by the soul in conformity
to nature, and is kept up for the health of living things. Pulsation,
therefore, is accomplished by a double agency: that is to
say, the expansion or dilatation is accomplished by the blood, but
the contraction or systole is accomplished in the egg by the membrane
of the vesicle, in the f&oelig;tus after birth by the auricles and
ventricles of the heart; and these alternate and mutually associated
efforts once begun, the blood is impelled through the whole body,
and thus the life of animals is perpetuated."<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Nearly two thousand years before Harvey's time
Aristotle had said:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The volume of leaven<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> changes from small to great, by its
more solid part becoming liquefied and its liquid, vaporized.<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a>
This is brought about in animals by the nature of the psychical
heat, but in the case of leaven by the heat of the blended juices."<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="noind">Moreover, Aristotle, as Harvey says, had likened to
"ebullition"<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> what Aristotle himself described as
"the pulsation which occurs at the heart, at which
the heart is always to be seen incessantly at work."
"For," says Aristotle, "ebullition takes place when
liquid is vaporized<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> by heat; for it rises up owing
to its bulk becoming greater."<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> He continues:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In the heart the swelling up from heat of the liquid which is
always arriving from the food produces pulsation, for the swelling
rises against the outer tunic<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> of the heart; and this process is
always and incessantly going on, for the liquid is always and incessantly
flowing in, out of which the nature of the blood arises; for
the blood is first worked up in the heart. The thing is plain in generation
from the beginning; for before the vessels have been marked
out the heart is to be seen containing blood. Hence, too, it pulsates
more in the young than in the old; for the vapor<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> arises more
abundantly in the young.</p>

<p>"All the vessels also pulsate and do so simultaneously one with
another, because they are dependent upon the heart.<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> This is
always moving, so that they, too, are always moving, and simultaneously
one with another, when<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> the heart moves. Leaping
[of the heart],<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> then, is the reaction which takes place against the
condensation produced by cold, and pulsation is the vaporization<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a>
of heated liquid."<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="noind">In another treatise Aristotle says: "In all animals the
blood pulsates in the vessels everywhere at the same
time."<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> It is interesting, in a negative way, that his
sweeping and faulty references to the pulsation of the
vessels put into words no physiological idea except the
vague one of "dependence" on the heart.</p>

<p>One may be tempted to see in the seething of the
heart's blood the source of some of those spirits within
the body elsewhere than in and about the heart, of
which one gets brief ill-defined glimpses here and
there in the genuine works of Aristotle. But no
words of his can be adduced to confirm such a conjecture.</p>

<p>Evidently, however, the seething of the nascent
blood suffices, in Aristotle's eyes, to explain both the
phases of the heart-beat; for both the rising and the
falling of the wall of the hot central laboratory of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
blood are movements as passive apparently as those
of the lid of a boiling pot. One may be excused for
wondering at the crudity of such a conception; nor
is one's wonder lessened by recalling that elsewhere
in Aristotle's works he places at the heart the central
origin of the bodily movements. But when it is recalled,
as well, that Aristotle was totally ignorant of the
function of muscle and, therefore, even of the mode of
working of the limbs, his doctrine of the heart-beat may
seem less amazing.</p>

<p>There are indications that the function of muscle,
though unknown to Aristotle, was known not long
after his time,<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> and in Galen's time that function was
entirely familiar, he styling the muscles "the organs of
voluntary movement," and calling their contraction
their "systole," a term which has survived only in
connection with the heart and arteries.<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> For Harvey,
born more than thirteen centuries after Galen's death,
the function of muscle was a portion of ancient knowledge;
and in his treatise On the Motion of the Heart
and Blood, he expressly states that the heart, including
the auricles, is muscular both in structure and in
function. The opinions of Harvey's day rendered
these statements by no means superfluous.<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> Naturally,
therefore, in accepting the aid of the Aristotelian
seething of the blood in connection with the heart-beat
Harvey utilized only the force of expansion thus
generated, and obtained from muscle the force of
contraction which he required. Indeed, the conception
of the auricles and ventricles as muscular force-pumps
was fundamental to his doctrine of the circulation.
Moreover, we have found Harvey careful to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
limit and mitigate the expansion of the blood, he saying
to Riolanus:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I accept Aristotle's parallel with pottage or milk with this
proviso, that the rising or falling of the blood is not brought about
by vapors, or exhalations, or spirits, excited into some vaporous or
aërial form, and is caused, not by an external agent, but by an internal
principle, and is regulated by nature."<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="noind">Long before, indeed, he had jotted down a terse statement
among his lecture notes which is fatal to any
extreme development of the Aristotelian idea. In
dealing with the action of the heart he had written:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"To what end? Aristotle: To none, but a passive process, as
in boiling pottage. But when wounded it gives out not wind, but
blood."<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Harvey, therefore, could do no less than criticize
adversely his famous contemporary, the philosopher
Descartes, for accepting in its entirety Aristotle's doctrine
of the heart-beat. Referring to Descartes he
says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Nor in the matter of the pulse am I satisfied with the efficient
cause thereof which he, following Aristotle, has laid down as the
same at the systole as at the diastole, to wit: an effervescence of
the blood like that produced in boiling. For the movements aforesaid
are sudden strokes and swift beats; while in fermentation or
ebullition nothing rises up and collapses thus, as it were in the
twinkling of an eye, but there is a slow swelling with a sufficient
subsidence. By means of dissection, moreover, one can discern for
oneself that the ventricles of the heart are expanded as well as
filled by the constriction of the auricles and are increased in size
proportionately, according as they are filled more or less; and that
the expansion of the heart is a movement of a certain violence,
produced by impulsion, not by attraction<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> of some sort."<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>In a letter written four years after the publication of
the Exercises to Riolanus and two years after that of
the treatise On Generation, Harvey sets forth anew,
with admirable clearness and brevity, his doctrine as
to the nature and cause of the systole of the ventricles.
In this he stands upon purely modern ground as an
observer, and his words are free from all Aristotelian
tinge. Referring to another physiologist he says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I could wish, however, that he had observed this one thing,
namely, that the motion which the heart enjoys is of a threefold
kind, to wit: a systole, in which the heart contracts itself and
drives out the blood contained in it; and then a certain relaxation,
of a character contrary to the foregoing motion, a relaxation in
which the fibres of the heart which make for motion are slackened.
The two motions aforesaid are inherent in the very substance of the
heart, just as in all other muscles. Finally, there takes place a
diastole, in which the heart is expanded by blood impelled into its
ventricles out of the auricles; and the heart is incited to its own
contraction by this filling and expansion of the ventricles; and the
motion aforesaid always precedes the systole, which follows at
once."<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="noind">Harvey materially clarifies his doctrine of the nature
and cause of the heart-beat in the following admirable
summary. In the second Exercise to Riolanus he
says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Since I see that many are embarrassed and doubt the circulation,
and that some attack it, because they have not understood
me thoroughly; for their sake I will recapitulate briefly what I
meant to say in my little book on the motion of the heart and blood.
The blood contained in the veins, where its deeps are, as it were,
where it is most abundant, that is, in the vena cava close to the base
of the heart and to the right auricle, gradually grows warm and thin
by reason of its own internal heat, and swells and rises up like
matters in fermentation; whereby the auricle is dilated, contracts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
itself by reason of its own pulsific faculty, and propels the blood
promptly and frequently into the right ventricle of the heart. This,
when filled, frees itself of blood at its succeeding systole by the
impulsion thereof and, as the tricuspid valve is a bar to the egress
of the blood, drives it where an open door is offered, into the arterial
vein, and thereby brings about the expansion of the latter. The
blood within the arterial vessels cannot now go back in opposition
to the sigmoid valve, while at the same time the lungs are widened
and enlarged and then narrowed by inspiration and expiration&mdash;and
with the lungs their vessels also&mdash;and offer to the blood aforesaid
a path and transit into the venous artery. The left auricle
accomplishes its movement, its rhythm, its order [of events], its
function, at the same time and in the same way as the right auricle,
and in like manner sends on into the left ventricle out of the vessels
aforesaid the same blood which the right auricle had sent on into
the right ventricle. As a result the left ventricle, at the same time
and in the same way as the right, impels the blood into the cavity
of the aorta and consequently into all the branches of the artery,
the return of the blood whence it had come being prevented in the
same way as before by the barrier of an opposing valve. The
arteries are filled by this sudden impulsion and, as they cannot
unload themselves as suddenly, are expanded, receive an impulse,
and undergo their diastole."<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Harvey seems to have attributed more importance
to the auricular systoles than do the physiologists of
to-day, he making the ventricles depend very greatly
for their charge of blood upon the systole of the auricles.
This view appears in three passages already
quoted; and is tersely put by Harvey when he says
elsewhere that the heart "is dilated by the auricle,
contracts of itself";<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> that "the auricles are prime
movers of the blood."<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> The unduly high value set
by him upon the auricular systole agrees well with the
polemical vigor with which Harvey exalted impulsion
and rejected suction,<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> in his general physiology as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
well as in the physiology of the heart. In the heart
especially the force of suction had played for centuries
a part which Harvey rejected more completely
than the physiologists of to-day feel warranted in
doing. Again he shall speak for himself, saying
tersely:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Hence it is made plain how the blood enters the ventricles;
not by reason of being drawn in, or of the heart expanding, but
because sent in by the pulse of the auricles."<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>"The expansion of the heart," he has told us already,
"is a movement of a certain violence, produced by
impulsion, not by attraction of some sort." He says
that he maintains these views</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="noind">"against the commonly received opinion; because neither the
heart nor anything else can so expand itself that it can draw anything
into itself in its diastole, unless as a sponge does which
has first been forcibly compressed and is returning to its natural
state."<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>But, one may ask oneself, how does that modified
seething in the vena cava which produces the diastole
of the right auricle produce the diastole, the simultaneous
diastole, of the left auricle? In his lecture notes
Harvey had stated, as Columbus had before him, that
the venous artery does not pulsate&mdash;at least, he means,
not in the same sense as the auricle, or ventricle, or
artery.<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> Obviously regarding the left auricle there
could be available, for Harvey, no explanation parallel
to that of to-day, viz.: the swift conduction of a stimulus
from point to point of the texture of a wall which is
common to both auricles. He is careful to state that
corresponding auricular events occur simultaneously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
and in the same way in the two auricles; and incidentally
but frankly he confesses ignorance of the reasons
why, in the following passage:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"From those who declare the causes and reasons of all things in
such a smattering way, I would be glad to learn how it is that both
eyes move together hither and thither and in every direction when
they look; how it is that this eye does not turn by itself in that
direction, that eye in this; likewise, both auricles of the heart;
and so forth."<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The circulation of the blood, then, according to the
final view of its discoverer, is maintained by a self-regulating
mechanism worked by causes operating
within the blood itself, the "principal part" of the
body. The systolic muscular contractions of the walls
of the ventricles are caused by direct mechanical
stimulation (in modern language) due to diastolic
distension by blood of the relaxed muscular walls of
these chambers. The blood which distends the ventricles
is driven forcibly into them by the auricular
systole, the muscular walls of the auricles having been
stimulated to contract by diastolic distention due likewise
to blood.</p>

<p>So much of Harvey's doctrine of the heart-beat,
although not that of to-day, is very effective as physiology,
and has advanced with modern swiftness far
beyond that of his predecessors. It seems strange,
therefore, even to one familiar with the movement of
the Renaissance, to be swept back nearly two thousand
years under Harvey's guidance to reach the underlying
cause of the phenomena. According to him the distention
which stimulates the right auricle to contract
is produced by an expansion of the blood of the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
veins, due to the innate heat. The Harveian heart-beat
is caused and initiated by an Aristotelian swelling
up of the hot blood. Both this expansion and the
fiery central hearth at which it is produced have been
expelled by Harvey from within the fully developed
heart; and the primal abode of the innate heat has
been transferred to the blood, with which that heat
has been intimately incorporated by him. Just without
the heart, moreover, Harvey has established anew
the Aristotelian seething; making this the result of
what we to-day may style a localized automatism of the
conjoined heat and blood. He has localized this
automatism of the hot blood "in the vena cava, close
to the base of the heart and to the right auricle," <i>i.e.</i>,
close to that region at and between the mouths of the
two venæ cavæ of our present terminology, where the
physiology of to-day places, not within the blood but
in the texture of the walls which contain it, the seat of
what is prepotent in determining the rhythm of the
mammalian heart-beat.</p>

<p>Observation shows that from seemingly pulseless
peripheral veins the blood continuously enters the
venæ cavæ, which pulsate visibly in the region of
Harvey's swelling of the blood. Yet in his lecture
notes, in dealing with the significance of the thick
resistent walls of the arterial vein and the aorta, he
wrote: "Neither the vena cava nor the venous artery
is of such construction, because they do not pulsate
but, rather, are attracted."<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> On a neighboring
page he had written:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"At the same time [that] the pulse of the artery is perceived by
touch, the vena cava is attracted, as it were."<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p class="noind">We will not now search for what he meant by saying
that "the vena cava is attracted, as it were."
Clearly, however, in denying that it pulsates, he meant
not to deny that its wall moves rhythmically, but to
deny only that this movement is of the nature of what
he styles pulsation in the case of the auricles or the
ventricles, or the arteries, or the arterial vein.</p>

<p>We know not what influence the rhythmic movements
of the wall of the vena cava may have had upon
Harvey's transfer to its cavity of the Aristotelian seething
of the blood. To this was referable the palpitation
seen by him in the blood itself as the first sign
of life in the embryo and the last sign of life in the dying
animal; and in this same familiar seething he found
ready to his hand a life-long cause for the visible sharp
expansion of the auricle in its diastole, for which expansion
he could find no such obvious muscular cause
as for the corresponding expansion of the ventricle or
the arteries. The seething of the blood, however, was
carefully kept by him below the point of vaporization
and adapted to maintain the circulation by keeping the
muscular cardiac pump at work.</p>

<p>Connected with Harvey's doctrine of the cause of the
heart-beat there is a point which a student of his
thought may find knotty, despite the aid of a well-developed
historical sense. Harvey made the systolic
contraction of auricle or ventricle dependent on the
mechanical stimulus of its next preceding diastolic
distension. It is not quite easy to see how he found
this process compatible with the orderly recurrence of
all the systolic contractions in the beating of a nearly
empty heart. It is well known that the heart may beat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
for a while when cut out of the body, when, therefore,
the heart is nearly drained of blood. In the treatise
of 1628 Harvey himself speaks of studying the ventricular
systole of "the heart of an eel, taken out and laid
upon the table or the hand"; and says that the phenomena
seen in this are seen likewise "in the hearts of
little fishes, and in those colder animals in which the
heart is conical or elongated."<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> In his lecture notes
he says, we remember, that "the auricles pulsate after
removal of the heart, because of the multitudinous
blood."<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> But this jotting, written only as a brief
reminder for himself, is obscure to others. By the
word "heart" Harvey means sometimes the ventricular
mass without the auricles and sometimes the
ventricular mass and the auricles taken together.
Hence it is uncertain whether the above reference be
to auricles left attached to the body or removed with the
ventricular mass. In neither case is it easy to imagine
effective distention produced by the seething even of
"the multitudinous blood." However, in the same
lecture notes a few pages farther on Harvey says:
"Nevertheless, the heart pulsates, cut away from the
auricles;"<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a> and in the treatise of 1628 he says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The heart of the eel and of some fishes, and of animals even,
when taken out, pulsates without auricles; indeed, if you cut it in
pieces you shall see its divided parts contracting and relaxing separately;
so that in these creatures the body of the heart pulsates
and palpitates after the auricles have ceased to move. Is this,
however, peculiar to the animals which are more tenacious of life,
whose radical moisture is more glutinous, or rich, and sticky,<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a>
and not so readily dissolved? For in eels the thing is apparent
even in their flesh, which retains the power of motion after they have
been skinned, drawn, and cut in pieces."<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>At this point we may recall the following words of our
author:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I affirm also that in this way the native heat or innate warmth,
being the common instrument of all the functions, is likewise the
prime efficient cause of the pulse."<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="noind">Should we hazard the improbable guess that Harvey
meant his cause of the heart-beat to be effective only
in warm-blooded animals, we must remind ourselves
that it certainly was well known to him as to all the
other physicians of his day that the heart of the mammal
beats after excision. If few had made experiments, all
had studied Galen; and Galen cites the beating of
the heart after excision as evidence that its beat does
not depend upon the nervous system, the context
making it obvious that he refers to the heart-beat of
the mammal. Moreover, he makes it evident that the
striking phenomenon in question must have been seen
by the ancients at the altar, as an incident of sacrificial
rites.<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> This fact makes it easy to understand how it
happened that earlier still, at least two centuries before
Galen's time, the layman Cicero, one of Harvey's
favorite authors, should have made a stoic say:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It has often been observed that, when the heart of some
animal has been torn out, it palpitates with a mobility which imitates
the swiftness of fire."<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="noind">Moreover, thirty-five years before Harvey was born,
even the beating of the excised human heart had been
seen by Vesalius, and referred to in his celebrated
treatise on anatomy, as an incident of one of the barbarous
executions of the sixteenth century.<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a></p>

<p>By no means in accord with the cause of the heart-beat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
first advocated by Harvey in 1649, is an experiment
which he himself had brought forward in support
of the circulation in 1628. In the famous treatise of
that year he tells us that if the vena cava of a living
snake be compressed at a point some distance away
from the heart, the vein between that point and the
heart is nearly emptied by the heart-beat, and the
heart itself becomes paler and shrinks from lack of
blood "and at length beats more languidly."<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> These
words show that in this experiment the orderly heart-beats
must have continued after the blood remaining
in the vena cava had become too scanty to excite them
by its expansion in accordance with his doctrine. It is,
therefore, an interesting question how Harvey could
reconcile the beating of the empty heart with his
belief as to the "prime efficient cause" of its beat.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h3>HARVEY'S DELINEATION OF THE VENOUS RETURN</h3>


<p>It may seem surprising that the discoverer of the
venous return felt the need of a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">deus ex machina</i> to distend
the right auricle. On reflection, however, ought
it to surprise us that, although we find the muscular
power of the heart sufficient to complete the Harveian
circulation, Harvey himself did not, but eked it out
with Aristotelian forces? Vigorous as Harvey was, he
could not make smooth the road which he himself had
broken. For instance, he could not study, like ourselves,
the return of the blood to the heart in the opened
chest of an animal anæsthetized and curarized. The
knowledge gained by his own tireless investigations did
not suffice to teach him what we now know, viz.: that
the unaided force of the systole of the left ventricle is
sufficient to distend the right auricle with blood and
to charge with blood the right ventricle as well.</p>

<p>The essence of Harvey's great discovery is his reversal
of the immemorial direction of the venous flow,
which he also proved to be abundant and rapid. But
the laws which rule this flow were not, and could not
be, patent to him as to us, owing to the imperfect
physiological knowledge of his day. Hence at times
his statements as to the movement of the blood are
conceived in what, to borrow an architectural phrase,
may be called a "transition style." As a sequel to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
doctrine of the cause of the heart-beat let us pass in
review some of these statements; but, first, let us briefly
note a few facts which may help us to realize the imperfect
state of the science of physics in Harvey's day.</p>

<p>Harvey was fourteen years younger than Galileo,
who struck crippling blows at the Aristotelian physics,
yet could not explain the common pump;<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> and Harvey's
discovery of the circulation was made public
thirteen years before the momentous work on the movement
of liquids done by Torricelli, who was thirty
years younger than Harvey.<a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> Moreover, it was only
a year before the publication of the Exercises to Riolanus
in Harvey's old age that Blaise Pascal supplied
the final proof that the mercurial column below the
vacuum of Torricelli's barometer is really sustained
by the pressure of the atmosphere.<a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> It was not till
one hundred years after the publication of Harvey's
discovery that the Reverend Stephen Hales published
the first comparative manometric measurements of
the blood-pressure in the arteries and the veins of the
same living animal, and stated in his preface that "the
animal fluids move by Hydraulick and Hydrostatical
Laws."<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a></p>

<p>Now let us turn to some delineations of the movement
of the blood made by Harvey himself. I have
found no evidence that he knew the venous flow to be
promoted by the aspiration of the chest; but he knew
well the effect of the muscular movements of the body
upon that flow. Of course he had a perfect grasp of the
fundamental truth that the main cause of the venous
return is the forcible emptying of the ventricles into
the arteries. He says to Riolanus:&mdash;</p>

<p>With the calm quantitative account which a reader
of Hales' "Statical Essays" will find given by that
clergyman of his epoch-making physical experiments
upon the blood-pressure, it is interesting to compare
the following vivid qualitative recital of inferences
made from surgical observations by his great predecessor.
Harvey says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Moreover, whoever shall have seen and thought upon the
amount of difficulty and exertion with which the blood is stanched
by compression, ligatures, or various appliances, when it leaps
impetuously out of a petty artery, even the smallest, which has
been cut or torn in two; and shall have seen or thought upon the
amount of force with which the blood, as though thrown out from a
syringe, flings off and drives before it the whole of the appliances,
or traverses them&mdash;that man will hardly believe it probable, I
think, that any of the blood can pass backward against so great an
impulse and influx of the entering blood, unless from a point whence
it is driven back with equal force."<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Harvey rightly discountenanced the ancient idea
of direct anastomoses between the mouths of veins
and the mouths of arteries, as opposed to fine and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
multiplied communications. In some situations, however,
he admitted that ampler communications exist
comparable to such anastomoses; and it throws light
upon his state of mind as to the movement of the blood
that, despite his recognition of the very forcible exit
of the blood from the arteries, he suggested in his old
age that in the cases aforesaid regurgitation from vein
to artery is guarded against by a valvular arrangement,
the terminal part of the artery traversing the wall of
the vein obliquely, as the ureter traverses the wall of
the bladder and as the biliary duct traverses the wall
of the duodenum.<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> We should not forget that in his
day the capillary vessels, the existence of the corpuscles,
and the chemistry of the blood were still unknown; so
that the passage into the veins of the mysterious hot
vital liquid through the "porosities" of the parts
might naturally present itself to his mind in a way very
strange to us. He tells us this:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The blood does not take its course through the looser texture
of flesh and parenchyma in the same way as through the more compact
consistency of tendinous parts. Indeed, the thinner and purer
and more spirituous part passes through more quickly; the thicker,
more earthy, ill-composed<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> part tarries longer and is rejected."<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>After more than twenty years of the comment and
criticism, called forth by his treatise of 1628, he said to
Riolanus:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"As to whether the moving blood be attracted, or impelled, or
move itself by virtue of its own intrinsic nature, enough has been
said in my little book on the motion of the heart and blood."<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="noind">Yet about two years after the Exercises to Riolanus,
Harvey, in writing a private letter, judged it necessary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
to accentuate, as follows, his denial that forces of
attraction really play the part in physiology which the
ancients had conceded to them. Speaking of the
impulsion of the blood through the arteries, he says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Indeed, the passage of the blood into the veins is brought about
by that impulsion and not by any dilatation of the veins whereby,
like bellows, they draw in the blood."<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>But, despite the foregoing utterances and other such,
his statements are sometimes vague and sometimes
quite unexpected, regarding the nature of the movement
of the blood in the veins. Indeed, in 1628 he
speaks quite as a disciple of Aristotle. He says regarding
the flow in the arteries:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"For this distribution and movement of the blood there is need
of impetus and violence and of an impeller such as the heart. Partly
because the blood readily concentrates and gathers together of
itself&mdash;toward its seat of origin, as it were,<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> or as a part to the
whole, or as a drop of the water sprinkled upon a table to the mass
thereof&mdash;as the blood habitually and very speedily does from slight
causes, from cold, fear, horror, and other causes of this sort; partly,
also, because the blood is pressed out of the capillary veins into the
small branches and thence into the greater by the movements of
the limbs and the compression of the muscles; the blood is more
disposed and prone to move from the circumference on the center
than the other way, even supposing no valves to be present as a
hindrance. In order, therefore, to relinquish its seat of origin, and
enter constricted and colder places, and move in opposition to its
bent,<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> the blood has need not only of violence but of an impeller,
such as is the heart alone, and after the fashion described already."<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>This picture of the blood hesitating to leave its warm
cardiac birthplace for the chill regions of the periphery,
but very ready to return, has a tone far from hydraulic,
but may so much the better prepare us for the view,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
made public by Harvey in his old age, that the blood
is the primal seat of the soul itself. Except in the light
of the foregoing passage the following words would
be quite obscure. He says that the auricles</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="noind">"are filled as being the storehouse and reservoir<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> of the blood,
the blood turning of itself and compressed toward the center by
the movement of the veins."<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>With due allowance for the use of modes of expression
no longer familiar we find Harvey in 1649 handling
the venous flow with no very modern touch, in the
following passage&mdash;a passage which also reminds us
that not till twelve years later, four years after Harvey's
death, did Malpighi announce his discovery of the
capillary blood-vessels in the lung of the frog.<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> Harvey
says to Riolanus:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The arteries are never depleted except into the veins or the
porosities of the parts, but are continually stuffed full by the pulse
of the heart; but in the vena cava and the circulatory vessels, into
which the blood glides at a quick pace and hastens toward the heart,
there would be the greatest scarcity of blood, did not all the parts
incessantly pour out again the blood poured into them. Add,
also, that the impetus of the blood which is urged and driven at
every pulsation into all parts of the second and third regions, forces
the blood contained therein from the porosities into the little veins
and from the branches into the larger vessels; this being effected
also by the motion and compression of the surrounding parts;
for contents are squeezed out of whatever contains them, when it
is compressed and narrowed. So by the movements of the muscles
and limbs the venous branches which creep on between are pressed
upon and narrowed, and push on the blood from the lesser toward
the greater."<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>A similar touch of vagueness is perceptible when
the venous flow is dealt with by Harvey in that very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
same résumé of the circulation which seats the underlying
cause of the pulse in the hot blood of the vena cava
close to the auricle. In that résumé he says to Riolanus:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I assert, further, that the blood in the veins courses always
and everywhere from the lesser into the greater and hastens from
all parts toward the heart; whence I gather that the amount, continuously
sent into the arteries, which the arteries have received
is transferred through the veins, and at length returns and flows
back whence it first was impelled; and that in this wise the blood
is moved in a circle in flux and reflux by the heart, by an impulsion
the impetus of which forces the blood through all the arterial filaments;
and that afterward in a continuous flow from all parts it
goes back through the veins, one after another, by which it is absorbed,
drained away, and transported."<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>As to the flow in the lungs Harvey says in the treatise
of 1628:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It being the will of nature that the blood itself be strained
through the lungs, she was obliged to superadd the right ventricle,
in order that by the beat thereof the blood might be driven through
the lungs themselves, out of the vena cava into the cavity of the
left ventricle."<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="noind">We have already found Harvey saying to Riolanus, in
regard to the pulmonary transit, that the blood within
the branches of the arterial vein</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="noind">"cannot now go back in opposition to the sigmoid valve, while at
the same time the lungs are widened and enlarged and then narrowed,
by inspiration and expiration, and with the lungs their vessels
also, and offer to the blood aforesaid a path and transit into the
venous artery."<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="noind">More than thirty-two years earlier Harvey had written
in his note-book the following words:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"N.B. The lungs by their movement in subsiding propel blood
from the arterial vein into the venous artery and thence into the
left auricle."<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>When we review and ponder the foregoing delineations
of the character of the movement of the blood,
we may cease to wonder that Harvey did not recognize
the simple hydraulic cause of the distention of the right
auricle and felt obliged to seek a more recondite explanation
thereof, finding this in an Aristotelian expansion
of the hot blood.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h3>THE BLOOD THE SEAT OF THE SOUL</h3>


<p>No doctrine of Harvey sounds stranger to a biologist
of to-day than his doctrine that the blood is the seat
of the soul; nor does any other belief of the great discoverer
reveal him more clearly to be a link between
the old and the new; not simply an innovator who
fixed a gulf between them. We have heard him explicitly
deny in his old age the Aristotelian doctrine
that the heart "is endowed with soul." We have seen
that thirty-five years earlier he had jotted down in his
note-book these words: "The soul is in the blood."<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a>
Let us study him now as he lays stress, not merely on
the primacy of the blood, but on its psychological
endowments.</p>

<p>Thirteen years before the date of Harvey's note-book
Shakspere's play of "Hamlet" had appeared in
print; in which the prince speaks thus of following his
father's ghost:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">"Why, what should be the fear?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I do not set my life at a pin's fee;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, for my soul, what can it do to that,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Being a thing immortal as itself?"<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noind">It has been foreshadowed that for Harvey, the graduate
of Cambridge and of Padua, the physician of the
Renaissance, the word "<em>anima</em>"&mdash;"soul"&mdash;did not
simply mean the immortal part of man, as for Hamlet,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
but was equivalent to the "<em>psyche</em>" of ancient philosophy.
In order, therefore, readily to follow Harvey's
thought at this juncture, we must first, like him, go
to the fountain head; for only sayings of Aristotle
can give us a sufficient clue to what he, and after him
Harvey, meant by "soul."</p>

<p>Aristotle says in his treatise On Soul:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Some natural bodies have life and some have not. By life we
mean the being nourished, and growing, and decaying, of oneself."</p></blockquote>

<p class="noind">In the same treatise he says further:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The soul is that by which primarily we are alive, and display
sensation and intellect; ... but it is not matter and substratum."</p></blockquote>

<p class="noind">Again he says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Were the eye an animal, vision would be the soul thereof;
for reason indicates that vision is the essence of the eye.<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> The eye
in its turn is the material [basis] of vision; which latter failing, the
eye is not an eye except in name, like an eye of stone or in a drawing."</p></blockquote>

<p class="noind">The doctrines of the foregoing three passages are
developed and made more explicit in the following,
still from the treatise On Soul:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It is the presence of life, we say, which makes the difference
between that which has soul and that which has not. To amplify
regarding life: we call anything alive which possesses even a single
one of the following: intellect, sensation, motion and rest in space,
and also the motion<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> involved in nutrition, and both decay and
growth. Therefore, even all the plants are held to be alive."</p></blockquote>

<p>A few lines further on Aristotle says, speaking of the
power or faculty<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a> of taking nourishment:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"This can exist without the others, but not the other faculties
without this, in mortal beings. The aforesaid is clear in the case<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
of plants; for they possess no other faculty of the soul. To this
faculty then life owes its origin in living things; but the being an
animal owes its origin primarily to sensation; for beings that
neither move nor change their place but yet possess sensation, we
call animals and not merely living things. The primary sense,
which exists in all, is touch; and just as the nutritive faculty can
exist without touch or sensation of any kind, so can touch exist
without the other senses. The "nutritive" is our term for such
part of the soul as is shared even by plants, all animals, however,
evidently possessing the sense of touch. The cause of the presence
of each of the two aforesaid shall be told later. Now let us only
go so far as to say that the soul is the source of the [faculties] aforesaid,
and is defined by means of them, to wit: the nutritive, the
sensory, the intellectual, the motor.<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> As to whether each of these
is a soul or is a part of the soul; and if a part, whether in the sense
that it is only separable by reasoning,<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> or locally as well&mdash;as to
some of these points, it is not hard to see our way, but some present
difficulties."<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>If we turn to Aristotle's treatise On Generation we
find him dealing with the relations of the body to the
nutritive soul, in virtue whereof the body is alive;
with its relations to the sensory soul, in virtue whereof
it is an animal body; and, finally, in man with its relations
to the intellectual soul. Of these three kinds of
soul or parts of the soul, he concludes, the mind "is
alone divine; for in the working thereof no bodily
working is involved."<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> Only soul of this divine
quality does he admit to be separable from body.<a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a></p>

<p>The master has spoken. Now let the great pupil
speak. In the last Exercise but one of his treatise
On Generation, Harvey says, referring to the blood:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It assuredly contains the soul first and foremost, not only the
nutritive, but the sensory soul as well, and the motor. The blood
penetrates in all directions and is present everywhere; if it be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
taken away, the soul itself is made away with also and at once; so
that the blood would seem to be wholly indistinguishable from the
soul or, at least, should be reckoned the substance of which the
soul is the activity. The soul I aver to be such that neither is it
body at all, nor yet entirely without body, but comes in part from
without, in part is born on the premises,<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> and in a manner is part
of the body; in a manner, however, is the origin and cause of everything
within the body of an animal, certainly of nutrition, sense,
and motion, and hence, in like manner, of life and death; for whatsoever
is nourished, that same is living, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vice versa</i>. So, likewise,
whatsoever is nourished abundantly, increases; but whatsoever
too sparingly, dwindles; and whatsoever is nourished
perfectly, keeps its health; whatsoever otherwise, lapses into
disease. Therefore, as is the soul, so also is the blood to be reckoned
the cause and author of youth and old age, of sleep and of
waking, and even of respiration also&mdash;especially in view of this,
that in the things of nature the first instrument contains within
itself an internal moving cause. Therefore, it comes to the same
whether one say that the soul and the blood, or the blood together
with the soul, or, if preferred, the soul together with the blood,
bring everything within an animal to pass."<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="noind">Only two years before these words were published the
aged Harvey had said the following:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Nor does the blood possess vigor, faculty, reason, motion, or
heat, as the gift of the heart."<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="noind">A comparison of the foregoing passages from Harvey
with the preceding passages from Aristotle makes it
clear that, for Harvey, although the soul dwells no
longer in its Aristotelian seat, it is no other than the
Aristotelian soul which pervades the "principal part"
of the body, the living blood of the Harveian circulation.</p>

<p>What proofs does Harvey offer that the soul is in the
blood? He has offered already one weighty piece of
evidence noted by many from of old in the chase, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
butchery, in sacrifice, in battle&mdash;the evidence from
fatal hæmorrhage. This had been set forth nineteen
centuries before him by one of his Hippocratic predecessors,
who had referred to the reasoning</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="noind">"used by those who say that the blood is the man; for, seeing men
slaughtered and the blood running out of the body, they conclude
that the blood is the soul of man."<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="noind">Presently Harvey himself shall tell us that in placing
the soul in the blood he is consciously reaffirming one
of the most ancient of beliefs; but he is far from basing
his adhesion to it merely on such immemorial evidence,
known to all, as the result of loss of blood, for he also
adduces once more his own observations of the early
embryo of the fowl, to prove not only the primacy of
the blood but the presence of the soul therein. His
testimony follows, and in reading it one must bear
carefully in mind that in Harvey's time no clear
scientific distinction had yet been worked out between
movements which imply sensation, and movements,
whether reflex or not, which do not depend
upon consciousness. In his treatise On Generation
Harvey says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"For my own part I am sure from numerous experiments that
not only motion is inherent in the leaping point,&mdash;which no one
denies&mdash;but sensation also. For you will see this point thrown
into varied commotion and, as it were, irritated, at any touch whatever,
even the slightest, just as sensitive bodies in general usually
give evidence of sensation by movements proper to themselves.
Moreover, if the injury be repeated often, the leaping point becomes
excited and the rhythm and order of its pulsations disturbed.
In like manner do we infer the presence of sensation in the so-called
sensitive plant and in zoöphytes, from the fact that when they are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
touched they draw themselves together as though taking it ill....
So there is no doubt that the leaping point lives, moves, and feels
like an animal."<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>In a later part of the same treatise he says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It is manifest that all motion and sensation do not proceed from
the brain, since we plainly perceive the presence of motion and sensation
before the brain has come into existence; what I have related
proves that clearly sensation and motion dawn forthwith in
the first droplet of blood in the egg, before a vestige of the body
has been formed. Moreover, in that first state of the structure or
constitution of the body which I have called the mucilaginous, before
any members are discernible and when the brain is nothing but
limpid water, if the body be only lightly pricked it moves, contracts,
and twists itself obscurely like a worm or caterpillar; so that it
gives clear evidence of sensation."<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="noind">In another Exercise of the same treatise he says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It is evident also from the generation of the chick, that whatever
the source of its life or the vegetative first cause of it may
be, this had a prior existence in the heart. Wherefore, if the said
first cause be itself the soul of the chick, it stands proved likewise
that this had a prior existence in the leaping point and the blood;
seeing that we observe therein motion and sensation; for it moves
and leaps like an animal. If, then, there exist in the leaping point
the soul, which (as I have taught in my account) constructs for
itself the rest of the body, nourishes and increases it, certainly from
the heart as from a fount the soul flows out<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> into the entire body.</p>

<p>"So, likewise, if the egg be prolific because there is a soul in it,
or (as Aristotle would have it) the vegetative part of the soul, it is
clearly proved that the leaping point, in other words the generative
part endowed with soul, springs from the soul of the egg, for nothing
is the author of itself, and that the soul is transferred from the egg
to the leaping point, next to the heart, and then to the chick."<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="noind">In still another chapter of his treatise On Generation
Harvey says:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Nor does the blood deserve to be called the original<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> part
and the principal part, merely because in it and by it motion
and pulsation are originated, but also because in the blood the
psychical heat first comes into existence, the vital spirits are
generated, and the soul itself inheres. For wherever the immediate
and principal instrument of the vegetative faculty is first
found, there probably the soul also is first present and takes its
origin thence; since the soul is inseparable from the spirits and the
innate heat....<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a></p>

<p>"The life then inheres in the blood (as we read also in Holy
Writ),<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> because therein the life and the soul are manifest first and
fail last....<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a></p>

<p>"It stands clearly proved that the blood is a generative part,
the source of life, the first to live and the last to die, the primary
seat of the soul; that in the blood, as in its source, the heat first and
chiefly abounds and flourishes; and that by and from the blood
all the other parts of the whole body are fostered and obtain their
life by means of the influx of heat. Indeed, the heat which accompanies
the blood floods, fosters, and preserves the entire body, as I
have demonstrated already in my book on the motion of the
blood."<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Harvey's proof that the blood is "the first to live
and the last to die," we have scanned already in an
earlier chapter of this paper. In the next chapter of
his treatise On Generation he says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"No heat is to be found, either innate or inflowing, other than
the blood, to be the soul's immediate instrument."<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="noind">On the next page, after briefly making certain suppositions,
he says further:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Why should we not affirm with equal reason that there is soul
in the blood; and also, since the blood is the first thing generated,
nourished, and moved, that out of the blood the soul is first evoked
and kindled? Certainly it is the blood in which vegetative and
sensitive workings first come to light; in which heat, the primary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
and immediate instrument of the soul, is innate; it is the blood
which is the common bond of body and soul, and in which as a
vehicle soul flows into all parts of the whole body."<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>But no matter how far on high the blood may have
been exalted by Harvey the physician and psychologist,
it is still subject to the lancet of Harvey the clinician,
the heir of Hippocrates; for in his treatise On Generation,
in the same Exercise with the foregoing passage,
occurs the following:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"While I assert that the seat of the soul is in the blood, first
and foremost, I would not have the false conclusion drawn from
this that all blood-letting is dangerous or hurtful; nor have it
believed, as the multitude believes, that just to the degree that
the blood is taken away does the life pass away at the same time,
because holy scripture has placed the life in the blood. For it
is known from everyday experience that the taking of blood is a
wholesome aid against very many diseases and is chief among the
universal remedies; seeing that depravity of the blood, or excess
thereof, is at the bottom of a very great host of diseases; and
that the timely evacuation of blood often brings exemption from
most dangerous diseases and even from death itself. For just to
the degree that the blood is taken away as our art prescribes, is an
addition made to life and health. This very thing has been taught
us by Nature, whom physicians set themselves to imitate; for Nature
often makes away with the gravest affections by means of a
large and critical evacuation by the nares, by menstruation, or by
hæmorrhoids."<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Not only does Harvey affirm that "the soul is in the
blood" and, as we have seen, appeal to observation
and experiment in support of this doctrine; but he
refers to those who had believed it before him, and
maintains it against Aristotle's express denial. We
have heard him testify as an observer; now let us hear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
him deal historically and polemically with the doctrine
in question. Quite simply, in the final work of his old
age, does the veteran tell of the wide acclaim which
at last has greeted his discovery of the circulation&mdash;the
most modern and revolutionary achievement of his
time. The contrast is startling when, in the same
breath, with equal simplicity he proceeds formally to
identify his own latest view of the significance of the
circulating blood with a doctrine which had been ancient
in ancient times; a doctrine not only found in the Old
Testament, but held by Greek thinkers who were historic
figures even in the eyes of Aristotle. In his treatise
On Generation Harvey says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I see that the admirable circulation of the blood which I discovered
long ago has proved satisfactory to nearly all, and that so
far no one has made any objection to it which greatly calls for
answer. Therefore, if I shall add the causes and uses of the circulation
and reveal other secrets of the blood, showing how much it
conduces to mortal happiness and to the welfare of soul as well as
body, that the blood be kept pure and sweet by a right regimen, I
truly believe that I shall do a work as useful and grateful to philosophers
and physicians as it will be new; and that the following
view will seem to nobody so improbable and absurd as it formerly
seemed to Aristotle, viz.: that the blood, a domestic deity as it
were, is the very soul within the body, as Critias and others thought
of old; they 'believing that capacity for sensation is the most special
attribute of the soul, and exists because of the nature of the
blood.' By others again that which derives from its own nature
the power of causing motion was held to be the soul; as Thales,
Diogenes, Heraclitus, Alcmæon, and others believed.<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> It is
made plain, however, by very numerous signs that both sensation
and motion inhere in the blood in spite of Aristotle's<a name="FNanchor_298_298" id="FNanchor_298_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> denial."<a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>We have noted with Harvey the doctrine of Leviticus,
which still rules the procedure of the Jewish butcher;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
and as we look backward to Athens across the centuries,
we find Plato putting this question into the
mouth of Socrates: "Whether it be the blood with
which we think, or air, or fire, or none of these."<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a>
In Hellas this doctrine had been well known before
Plato, Socrates, or the Hippocratic writers, one of
whom we have found referring to it. The Sicilian
Greek Empedocles, a philosopher and physician born
at Acragas about 495 <small>B.C.</small>, is said to have held, long
before Aristotle, that the heart is the part formed first
in the embryo;<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a> and in a line of verse which has come
down to us Empedocles said: "In the blood about
man's heart is his understanding."<a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a> Empedocles is
reported to have held to this because in the blood "are
most perfectly blended the elements of the parts,"<a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a>
that is, earth, water, air, and fire.</p>

<p>The accomplished and wicked Athenian Critias, to
whom Harvey refers, was that chief of the Thirty
Tyrants who was slain in 403 <small>B.C</small>., four years before
Socrates drank the hemlock and nineteen years before
the birth of Aristotle. With the opinion of "Critias
and others" Harvey, as we have seen, identifies his
own view that the soul is in the blood. They held
capacity for sensation to be the mark of soul and to be
due to the nature of the blood; and Harvey's statement
of these views is a literal quotation from the second
chapter of the first book of Aristotle's treatise On Soul,
which Harvey cites. This chapter is also the source
of his summary and not quite exact reference to those
other ancients who, as he avers, held spontaneous motor
power to be the mark of soul&mdash;a power which Harvey
unites in the blood with capacity for sensation.<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>In the aforesaid chapter of Aristotle's work On Soul
this philosopher had curtly reckoned among the
"cruder" thinkers those of his predecessors who,
"like Critias," had held the soul to be blood. Harvey
notes the master's condemnation, but, as we have seen,
stoutly ranges himself with the condemned ancients
and affirms that sensation is inherent in the blood
despite the master's denial. It is strange to note how
the London physician seems less modern, for the moment,
than the ancient philosopher of Athens. Aristotle,
like a man of to-day, treats the blood simply as the
immediate food of the tissues, noting expressly that it
has "no feeling when touched in any animal, just as
the excrement in the belly has no feeling."<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a> Harvey
deals as follows with this obvious truth in dealing with
the question whether the blood can properly be reckoned
a part of the body in the technical sense. He
says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"At this time I will only say this: Even if we concede that the
blood does not feel, nevertheless, it does not follow that it is not
a part of a sensitive body and the principal part at that."<a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>We do not know that Aristotle ever saw or noted in
the dying auricle the "undulation" by which Harvey
was so much impressed; but we have seen that, like
Harvey, Aristotle treated of the development of the
early embryo within the hen's egg and that, like Harvey,
he laid special stress upon the red "leaping point."
Aristotle concluded that the heart is the first generated
living part, that it makes and will make throughout
life the blood which it contains and distributes. In
the heart he fixed the focus of the innate heat and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
knowing nothing of the nervous system, he fixed in the
heart the seat of the soul also. Harvey came to the
conclusion that the blood is the first generated living
part; that it has made the heart which contains it and
which keeps it circulating and which it will nourish
throughout life, as it will the other parts. In the blood
itself he placed the innate heat and, though he knew the
nervous system, he placed in the circulating blood the
seat of the soul, which animates every part.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"We conclude," he says, "that the blood lives and is nourished
of itself and in no wise depends upon any other bodily part either
prior to or more excellent than itself."<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Thus the rigorously proved and demonstrated circulation
of the blood was linked by its discoverer with
the speculations of remote antiquity.</p>

<p>As we have seen, the use of the circulation became to
Harvey a life-long subject of speculation, because this
discovery had raised questions which no man could
answer before the finding of oxygen. How obscure a
problem Harvey found the functions of the blood to be,
is nowhere better indicated than where he says in his
old age:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"So with better right one might maintain that the blood is
equally the material of the body and its preserver, but not merely
its food. For it is well known that in animals that perish of hunger,
and also in men who waste away and die, there is abundance of
blood to be found in the vessels, even after death."<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="noind">Is it the least part of Harvey's glory that his mind
had cloven its way through long-lived beliefs to a truth
which he could demonstrate but could not explain,
and which seemed to other eminent men to be no truth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
because too senseless to be true?<a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a> When he finally
broke with the ancient master, Harvey could not be
content with sheer ignorance; and the same observations
and experiments which led him out of Aristotelian
error misled him into error quite as grave. As to the
venerable doctrine regarding the seat of the soul,
which he at last embraced upon grounds now seen to be
too slender, was not this doctrine one with which the
Harveian circulation could harmonize well and which
in turn could greatly glorify the circulation? Let us
pause, think, and read further.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<h3>THE BLOOD THE INNATE HEAT</h3>


<p>The latter part of Harvey's treatise On Generation
is devoted to that of the mammal; but the treatise
does not end with the end of this subject, for from his
account of generation the author turns abruptly to
append two Exercises on other topics. The first of
these two is entitled "On the Innate Heat," and the
second, which is very brief, is entitled "On the Primitive
Moisture."</p>

<p>The Exercise On the Innate Heat is Harvey's express
and polemical contribution to this subject, which had
been much discussed both during and before his time;<a name="FNanchor_310_310" id="FNanchor_310_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a>
a subject with which the famous discoverer deals
roundly by maintaining that the innate heat is neither
more nor less than the circulating blood. So the last
words as to the significance of the circulating blood
which he wrote for publication are contained in this
Exercise. It begins as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Since mention is often made of the innate heat, I propose now,
by way of dessert, briefly to discuss the same and the primitive
moisture also; and this the more willingly that I see there are many
who take the greatest delight in those names and yet, in my judgment,
comprehend but little of the things themselves. Truly, there
is no need to seek for any spirits distinct from the blood, or to
bring in heat from elsewhere, or call gods upon the stage and load
philosophy with fanciful opinions; for what we so commonly would
fetch from the stars is born at home. In truth, the blood alone is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
the innate warmth, or the first-born psychical heat;<a name="FNanchor_311_311" id="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a> as is proved
excellently well by our observations of the generation of animals,
especially of the chick in the egg; so that it were superfluous
to multiply entities. Indeed, there is nothing to be met with in
the animal body prior to the blood, or more excellent; nor are the
spirits which they distinguish from the blood to be found anywhere
separate from it; for the very blood itself, if without spirits or
heat, does not deserve the name of blood, but of cruor....</p>

<p>"Scaliger, Fernelius, and others lay less weight on the extraordinary
endowments of the blood and imagine other spirits to
exist, aërial or ethereal or composed of substance both ethereal and
elemental, constituting an innate heat more excellent and more
divine, as it were; and these spirits they believe to be the soul's
most immediate instrument, the fittest for every use. They rely
especially upon this argument, viz.: that the blood, being composed
of elements, can exert no activity beyond the powers of the elements
or of bodies consisting of a mixture thereof. Therefore, they imagine
a spirit, another innate heat, of celestial origin and nature,
to wit: a body most simple, most subtile, most fine, most mobile,
most swift, most clear, ethereal, and sharing in the quintessence.
Nowhere, however, has any such gift of spirit been demonstrated
by them, nor that the same acts beyond the powers of the elements,
or accomplishes greater works than could the blood alone. As for
us who use our senses to guide us in the scrutiny of things, nowhere
have we been able to find anything of the kind. Furthermore,
there exist no cavities destined for the generation or preservation of
these spirits, or even assigned thereto by the persons aforesaid."<a name="FNanchor_312_312" id="FNanchor_312_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="noind">A little farther on we read:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I deem it, however, most wonderful that spirits which draw
their origin from heaven and are adorned with such surpassing endowments
should be nourished by our common and elemental air;
especially seeing that their advocates hold that none of the elements
can act beyond its own powers....<a name="FNanchor_313_313" id="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a> What need then is there,
say I, of that foreign guest, ethereal heat, since all can be accomplished
by the blood, even as by it; while from the blood the
spirits cannot withdraw a hair's breadth without perishing? Most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
assuredly nowhere do they wander or penetrate as separate bodies
without the blood. For whether it be said that they are generated,
nourished, and increased from the thinner part of the blood, as some
believe, or from the primitive moisture, as others hold; yet it is
confessed that they are never found outside the blood but forever
cleave to the same as to their sustenance, as flame does to oil or to
a wick. Wherefore their tenuity, subtility, mobility, and so forth,
confer no greater advantage than does the blood which they continually
accompany. It follows that the blood suffices and is
fit to be the immediate instrument of the soul, since the blood is
present everywhere and most swiftly permeates hither and
thither."<a name="FNanchor_314_314" id="FNanchor_314_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The two opponents named by Harvey were not his
contemporaries, but worthies of the Renaissance who
had written about one hundred years before the publication
of his treatise On Generation and had died before
he was born. The Italian physician Julius Cæsar
Scaliger had written learned commentaries on Aristotle,
as well as other works; and the Frenchman Jean
Fernel, physician to King Henri II of France, had
taught anatomy at Paris and had been a medical
writer of importance. Each of these two authors was
nearly sixty years of age in 1543, in which memorable
year were first published the revolutionary writings of
the aged astronomer Copernicus and of the young
anatomist Vesalius, in the second year after the death
of the hardy innovator Paracelsus. Such were the
men against whose doctrines Harvey was impelled in
his old age to launch his vigorous criticism, in order to
clear the way for his own doctrine of the preëminence
of the blood. What can we workers of to-day make of
their opinions, which were living for Harvey but now
are so deeply buried? Test-tube and balance, telescope,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
spectroscope, microscope, manometer, and the rest,
have served their purpose so well since Harvey's
time that even he, one of the foremost worthies of
science, must seem merely to beat the air with words in
his last message to us, unless we can recover his standpoint.
Happily he himself shall attempt to clarify
the meaning of his polemic by setting before us certain
words of Aristotle, embodying far-reaching speculations
as to body and soul in relation to the universe.
Yet we shall find these not easy to understand.</p>

<p>Let Harvey continue his criticism of his predecessors.
He says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"But while they believe that there are found in animals spirits
and ultimate or primitive nourishment, or something else, which
acts beyond the powers of the elements more than does the blood,
they do not seem to have a sufficient grasp of what it may be to
'act beyond the powers of the elements'; nor have they rightly
interpreted the words of Aristotle where he says:<a name="FNanchor_315_315" id="FNanchor_315_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a> 'The virtue or
potency of every soul<a name="FNanchor_316_316" id="FNanchor_316_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a> seems to be associated with a body<a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a>
other than the so-called elements and more divine.'"</p></blockquote>

<p class="noind">And a little farther on:<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a>&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"'For there exists in the semen of all [animals] that which
makes their semen generative, the so-called heat. Yet this is not
fire, nor any such power, but the spirits<a name="FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> included in the semen and
in foaminess, and in the spirits the nature which is analogous to the
element of the stars.[320] Wherefore fire generates no animal, nor
does anything [animal] appear in process of formation in that,
whether moist or dry, which is undergoing the action of fire;<a name="FNanchor_321_321" id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a>
whereas the heat of the sun and that of animals&mdash;not only that
[which acts] through the semen,<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> but also, should there occur some
excretion of a different nature<a name="FNanchor_323_323" id="FNanchor_323_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a>&mdash;even this, too, possesses a life-giving
principle. It is patent, then, from such [facts] as these
that the heat in animals is not fire and does not take its origin
from fire.'<a name="FNanchor_324_324" id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>"I, too, would say the same, for my part, of the innate heat and
the blood, to wit: that it is not fire and does not take its origin
from fire, but is associated with another body and that more divine,
and, therefore, does not act by reason of any elemental faculty; but,
just as there exists in the semen something which makes it generative
and exceeds the powers of the elements in building an animal&mdash;to
wit, spirits, and in the spirits a nature analogous<a name="FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> to the element
of the stars&mdash;so likewise in the blood there exist spirits or
some power which acts beyond the powers of the elements, a power
very conspicuous in the nourishing and preserving of the several
parts of an animal; and in the spirits and blood exist a nature,
yea, a soul, analogous to the element of the stars. It is manifest,
therefore, that the heat in the blood of animals during life is not
fire and does not take its origin from fire; and this is taught excellently
well by our own observations....<a name="FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a></p>

<p>"Therefore, those who assert that nothing composed of the elements
can work beyond the powers of these, unless it be associated
at the same time with another body and that more divine, and maintain,
therefore, that the spirits aforesaid consist in part of the elements,
in part of some ethereal and celestial substance&mdash;truly,
such persons seem to me to have drawn their conclusions ill. For
you shall find scarcely any elemental body which, when in action,
will not exceed its own proper powers."<a name="FNanchor_327_327" id="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>On reaching the end of the last quoted words of
Harvey's polemic, a physician or biologist of to-day may
easily be conscious of disappointment, even of a mild
despair; for the once celebrated passage from Aristotle,
about the interpretation of which Harvey gives battle,
seems at first the source of all the obscurities of the
controversy, rather than of the promised light which
shall clear them away. Yet that light must come by
way of that rugged passage. The gist of the first part
of the Aristotelian passage may be set forth as follows:
In the semen soul is potential, being associated
therein with a "body" or "nature" which possesses a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
"life-giving principle" and is in the spirits, <i>i.e.</i>, in the
hot vapor, within the foam-bubbles of the semen. This
body or nature is called heat, yet it is not that one of
the four elemental bodies which is known as fire, nor
yet a derivative of this, but is "a body other than the
so-called elements and more divine," a "nature analogous
to the element of the stars." What is this "element
of the stars"? It is clear that only from the
answer to this question can the light which we are seeking
begin to shine. To find this celestial element we
must immediately take a rapid glance at the Aristotelian
universe&mdash;that grand conception which the
master mainly accepted from his predecessors and contemporaries,
but owed, in part, to the work of his own
mind. Let us swiftly scan what he styled the "Cosmos."</p>

<p>At the center thereof is the earth, spherical and
motionless. The core of the universe consists not only
of this central globe with everything in or upon it, but
also of the atmosphere or, more correctly, of all which
extends between the surface of the globe and the nearest
of the distant revolving hollow spheres of heaven, in
some of which spheres are set the heavenly bodies.
Below the heavenly spheres this core of the universe is
made up of the four elements, earth, water, air, and
fire; and all things composed of these are subject to
opposed and limited and compounded motions, to
generation, alteration, and corruption. The inclosing
heaven, on the other hand, is unchangeable and eternal,
has never been created, and will never be destroyed.
Its many component hollow spheres are contiguous
and concentric, and concentric also with our globe. In
a single sphere, the outermost, called the "first heaven,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
all the fixed stars are set. In separate spheres, nearer
to the earth, are set the seven bodies which the astronomy
of Aristotle's day styled "planets." To
these (here designated by their present names) that
ancient astronomy assigned the following order from
the earth outward toward the fixed stars: the moon, the
sun, Venus, Mercury, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn.
Each of the celestial spheres revolves with simple circular
motion in one direction forever. The "first
heaven," the sphere of the fixed stars, needs but the
one simple motion which is its own, and it carries with
it in its daily revolution all the inner spheres. These
are more numerous than the seven planets; for though
each planet is set in but a single sphere, each planet's
complex course results from the combined simple motions
of more spheres than one. In spite of these
more or less intimate relations, the spheres of heaven
are separate existences, self-moved, like animals; and,
like animals, possess activity, life, and soul. But the
motion and life of the heavenly existences are continuous
and eternal, and hence these existences&mdash;the
spheres, and the planets and fixed stars set therein&mdash;are
all divine; much more divine than man, though
man possesses a far larger share of the divine than
other animals.<a name="FNanchor_328_328" id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a></p>

<p>Just as the troubled regions which lie below the
sphere of the moon are contrasted with the serene
heaven which incloses and limits them, so the changing
forms of matter which compose our globe and its nearer
surroundings are contrasted with the simple unalterable
substance of the heavenly spheres. "Of necessity,"
says Aristotle, "there exists a simple body whose very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
nature it is to be borne on in circular motion."<a name="FNanchor_329_329" id="FNanchor_329_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a>
Elsewhere he says that the men of old "would seem to
have assumed that the body which moves forever is
likewise divine by nature."<a name="FNanchor_330_330" id="FNanchor_330_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a> This is "an embodied
substance different from the compounds here, more
divine and prior to them all";<a name="FNanchor_331_331" id="FNanchor_331_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> a body "of a nature
the more precious the farther it is withdrawn from what
is here."<a name="FNanchor_332_332" id="FNanchor_332_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a> After reasoning about this body Aristotle
says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"If what has been laid down be accepted, it is plain from the
foregoing why the first of bodies is eternal, and shows neither
growth nor decay nor old age nor alteration, and is affected by
nothing. The conception seems to testify to the phenomena and the
phenomena to the conception.... Therefore, as the first body
is something different from earth and fire and air and water, [the
ancients] gave the name of ether to the region most on high, naming
it from its moving always during all eternity."<a name="FNanchor_333_333" id="FNanchor_333_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="noind">The place in nature of "the first element," so grandly
conceived, is fixed more definitely by Aristotle when he
says "that the whole universe in the region of the
courses on high is filled with that body."<a name="FNanchor_334_334" id="FNanchor_334_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a></p>

<p>Now, therefore, we have attained the object of our
rapid quest; at last we have reached "the element of
the stars"; for Aristotle tells us that not only heaven,
but all the heavenly bodies as well, consist of the
ether, saying:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It is most reasonable and consequent, in view of things already
said, for us to make each of the stars out of that body in which it
has its course, since we have declared the existence of something
of which the nature is to be borne in a circle."<a name="FNanchor_335_335" id="FNanchor_335_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="noind">At a later day the ethereal element of the stars was distinguished
from the four inferior elements not by its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
Aristotelian name of first element but by that of fifth
element, or fifth existence, or fifth "essence." Hence
arose and was applied to the fifth element the name
"quintessence"; a word which in its turn acquired
various meanings.</p>

<p>Ten years after Harvey's death Milton published his
description of the creation of heaven; a description
couched, however, in terms of the uncreated heaven of
Aristotle. Milton wrote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"And this ethereal quintessence of heaven<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flew upward, spirited with various forms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That roll'd orbicular, and turned to stars<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Numberless, as thou seest, and how they move;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each had his place appointed, each his course;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rest in circuit walls this universe."<a name="FNanchor_336_336" id="FNanchor_336_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>We may now return from this excursion through the
"Cosmos," to bring its light to bear upon those high-sounding
words of Aristotle which, according to Harvey,
formed the basis of speculations about the innate heat,
the spirits, and the blood, which were handed down by
"Scaliger, Fernelius, and others," and affected the
views of Harvey himself. Aristotle had written:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The virtue or potency of every soul<a href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a> seems to be associated
with a body<a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a> other than the so-called elements, and more divine."</p></blockquote>

<p class="noind">And a little farther on:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"For there exists in the semen of all [animals] that which makes
their semen generative, the so-called heat. Yet this is not fire, nor
any such power, but the spirits<a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> included in the semen and in
foaminess, and in the spirits the nature which is analogous to the
element of the stars."<a name="FNanchor_337_337" id="FNanchor_337_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="noind">That generative heat which is not elemental fire, but a
"body" or "nature" diviner than the lower elements,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
can be the analogue of nothing else than the celestial
ether.</p>

<p>What led Aristotle to so lofty a flight of speculation?
He does not tell. One may guess, however, that it
may well have been this: that he had found himself
obliged not only to deny the identity of the generative
heat of the semen with elemental fire, but also to deny
the identity with elemental fire even of the glowing
sun, as well as of the other planets and the fixed stars;
and to maintain that all the heavenly bodies consist of
ether. These denials we have read already; they shall
presently be commented on. Taking them for granted:
now, since the life-giving sun is not elemental fire but
ether, would not the life-giving seminal heat, which also
is not elemental fire, naturally be the analogue of the
ether? "Man and the sun generate man," said
Aristotle, in a famous passage.<a name="FNanchor_338_338" id="FNanchor_338_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a> He needed no knowledge
of chlorophyll to teach him this. The ether is the
element of the sun, moon, stars, and spheres; of it
consist the bodies associated with the souls of the living,
unalterable, immortal, divine existences of the eternal
heaven. To associate a body analogous to this ether
with the dormant soul of a living existence&mdash;a living
existence alterable and mortal as an individual, but
one of an immortal race&mdash;in the medium which shall
maintain that racial immortality by begetting a new
individual out of the lower elements&mdash;this is a stroke
characteristic of the man who declared that "the race
of men, and of animals, and of plants, exists forever";<a name="FNanchor_339_339" id="FNanchor_339_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a>
the man who assigned to every bloodless animal an
analogue of the blood and an analogue of the heart,<a name="FNanchor_340_340" id="FNanchor_340_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a>
to the octopus, an analogue of the brain;<a name="FNanchor_341_341" id="FNanchor_341_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a> the man in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
whose eyes the heavenly bodies were divine living
existences running eternal courses and so, we may
presume, were analogous in some degree to the living
existences of the earth.<a name="FNanchor_342_342" id="FNanchor_342_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a></p>

<p>Harvey in one of the earlier Exercises of his treatise
On Generation had already followed the ancient master's
footsteps in this matter. Discoursing of the endless
succession of generations the pupil says that this</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="noind">"makes the race of fowls eternal; since now the chick and now the
egg, in an ever-continued series, produce an immortal species out
of individuals which fail and perish. We discern, too, that in similar
fashion many lower things rival the perpetuity of higher things.
And whether or no we say that there is a soul in the egg, it clearly
appears from the cycle aforesaid that there underlies this revolution
from hen to egg and from egg again to hen, a principle which
bestows eternity upon them. That same, according to Aristotle,<a name="FNanchor_343_343" id="FNanchor_343_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a>
is analogous to the element of the stars; and it makes parents generate,
makes their semen or eggs prolific, and, like Proteus, is ever
present."<a name="FNanchor_344_344" id="FNanchor_344_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Let us return now to Harvey's polemic. In it he
does not give chapter and verse by which we can properly
verify more than a few of his statements of the
views of "Scaliger, Fernelius, and others"; but the
words of Aristotle which Harvey quotes go far to
justify his intimation that the views which he states
and combats, as the champion of the circulating blood,
are largely derived from those Aristotelian words&mdash;whether
by misinterpretation, as he roundly but indefinitely
declares, or with deliberate modification of
doctrine, need not now concern us.</p>

<p>At the very outset of Harvey's discourse about the
innate heat, the first doctrine that he reprobates is a
striking one, viz.: that the innate heat is one and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
same thing with spirits distinguishable from the blood,
though not separable from it. Of these spirits he
stoutly denies the existence, on the true scientific
ground of lack of all evidence from observation in their
favor. Our earlier studies of ancient doctrines of
respiration have brought before us, as supposed to
exist in the blood, spirits variously styled "elemental,"
"aërial," "nourished by our common and elemental
air," "nourished and increased from the thinner part
of the blood." We have even read Galen's words
of spirits which are "the soul's most immediate instrument,"
viz.: the "animal spirits" in the brain and
nerves. Indeed, during the eighteen centuries between
the death of Aristotle and the boyhood of Fernelius and
Scaliger, the word "<i lang="el" xml:lang="el">pneuma</i>"&mdash;"spirits" or "spirit"&mdash;did
most varied duties in the service of physicians,
philosophers, alchemists, and theologians; and this
same word is of great importance in the scriptures.<a name="FNanchor_345_345" id="FNanchor_345_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a>
It is noticeable that, although Harvey rejects the doctrine
of spirits in the blood, even he himself talks of the
blood being itself spirits.<a name="FNanchor_346_346" id="FNanchor_346_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a> This fact, however, should
not militate against him or lead to confusion. The
word "spirits" being a very comprehensive technical
term of his day, he does not refuse to employ it as a
label for qualities of the blood after he has denied the
very existence of what is properly denoted by the word
"spirits." He simply behaves as we behave when we
talk of the "sympathetic" nerves, though the theory is
exploded which the adjective expresses; or when we
speak of "animal cell," well knowing that no proper
wall necessarily surrounds the living substance.</p>

<p>Despite the protean forms of the spirits it is not till<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
we have reached Harvey's Exercise On the Innate Heat
that we have fallen in with spirits in the blood which, for
some of his predecessors, "constitute an innate heat
more excellent and more divine, as it were"; nor with
"a spirit, another innate heat, of celestial origin and
nature." For this treatment of spirits within the blood
and of innate heat, as convertible terms, the way may
well have been paved by the words in which Aristotle
intimates that the generative heat of the semen resides
in the spirits therein, <i>i.e.</i>, in hot vapor produced within
the body of the male and included within the films of
foam-bubbles in the semen. Referring to "the so-called
heat" the words of Aristotle are: "Yet this is
not fire nor any such power, but the spirits included in
the semen and in foaminess, and in the spirits the
nature which is analogous to the element of the stars."<a name="FNanchor_347_347" id="FNanchor_347_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a>
The transition can hardly have been too difficult from
the view of Aristotle that in the spirits of the semen is
heat which is not elemental fire, to the view combated
by Harvey that the spirits of the blood are heat which is
not elemental fire.</p>

<p>Aristotle's striking biological doctrine that the generative
seminal heat is a "nature which is analogous to
the element of the stars" appears to be an obvious
source of those seeming fantasies, written down eighteen
centuries later, at which Harvey girds when he says:
"For what we so commonly would fetch from the stars
is born at home." If we use our judgment simply,
upon Harvey's statement of their opinions, the men
whom he castigates, having strayed from the ancient
master's footsteps by making the spirits one and the
same with the innate heat instead of the vehicle thereof,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
next stray still more blindly by identifying this heat,
<em>alias</em> these spirits, not with an analogue of the ether,
but with a portion of the ether itself. Therefore is it
that we read in the words of Harvey's polemic, of "that
foreign guest, ethereal heat"; of those spirits "aërial or
ethereal, or composed of substance both ethereal and
elemental"; of spirits "which draw their origin from
heaven" and elicit Harvey's ironical wonder that they
"should be nourished by our common and elemental
air." Therefore, too, is he able to tell us of that amazing
spirit, <em>alias</em> innate heat, which is "a body" and qualified
by many imposing adjectives and finally styled "ethereal
and sharing in the quintessence." The doctrine of
Aristotle that in the semen there are spirits which are
the vehicle of generative heat which is analogous to the
element of the stars, is a baseless doctrine, but it is a
subtle and far-reaching speculation. The doctrine
stated and attacked by Harvey that in the blood there
are spirits which are the innate heat, which consists
as a whole or in part of the element of the stars, is not
only a baseless doctrine, as Harvey vigorously shows,
but certainly is lame as speculation despite its glittering
appeal to the imagination. To make spirits and innate
heat convertible terms may pass as but one among
many phases of speculation. But to bring down
actual ether from heaven to earth, although attempted
by eminent thinkers<a name="FNanchor_348_348" id="FNanchor_348_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a> centuries before Scaliger and
Fernelius, is to bring chaos into that conception of the
universe which requires the "first element" to revolve
forever on high, above that lower world which lies
beneath the sphere of the moon. To Aristotle such
chaos surely would have been abhorrent; indeed, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
runs counter to his expressed description of the ether.<a name="FNanchor_349_349" id="FNanchor_349_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a>
Moreover, Aristotle's application of the term "analogue"
to the generative heat is equivalent to a denial
that the generative heat is actually ether; for analogues
do frequent service in his doctrines and he explicitly
states the analogue of a thing to be something different
from the thing itself.<a name="FNanchor_350_350" id="FNanchor_350_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a> What that mysterious analogue
of the ether may be with which the generative heat is
identified we are not explicitly told, as we are not told
what the analogue of the heat may be in bloodless
animals. We are left to judge for ourselves after
deeper investigation of nature or deeper study of the
Aristotelian writings. Had Aristotle been ready to
define and describe the body which is more divine than
the four lower elements, but is not the first element on
high, he probably would not have chosen an analogue
as the fittest vehicle for his thought.</p>

<p>According to Harvey the horse of battle of his criticized
predecessors was the argument stated by him as
follows: "That nothing composed of the elements can
work beyond the powers of these, unless it be associated
at the same time with another body and that
more divine; and ... therefore, that the spirits
aforesaid consist in part of the elements, in part of
some ethereal and celestial substance."<a name="FNanchor_351_351" id="FNanchor_351_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a> The "spirits
aforesaid" are held to be one and the same with the
innate heat and reside in the blood. Aristotle had
written, we remember: "The virtue or potency of
every soul seems to be associated with a body other
than the so-called elements and more divine,"<a name="FNanchor_352_352" id="FNanchor_352_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a> viz.:
the generative seminal heat, which is not fire but an
analogue of the ether. It would seem fairly probable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
that largely from this doctrine of Aristotle was developed
the doctrine about the "powers of the elements"
which Harvey sets forth in his polemic. Nothing can
be more emphatic than his disagreement with the
advocates of this doctrine. "Such persons," he says,
"seem to me to have drawn their conclusions ill. For
you shall find scarcely any elemental body which, when
in action, will not exceed its own proper powers."<a name="FNanchor_353_353" id="FNanchor_353_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a>
On the same page with this sweeping statement we
find it supported by the following very simple line of
thought:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"All natural bodies present themselves in a double relation, to
wit: according as they are reckoned with apart and comprehended
within the circuit of their own proper nature, or according as they
are the instruments of some nobler and superior authority. For,
as to their own proper powers, there is no doubt that all things
which are subject to generation and corruption derive their origin
from the elements, and work according to the standard thereof.
In so far, however, as all things so subject are instruments of a
more excellent agent and are regulated thereby, their works do not
proceed from their own proper nature but from the rule of that
other; and, consequently, they seem to be associated with another
and more divine body and to exceed the powers of the elements."<a name="FNanchor_354_354" id="FNanchor_354_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>In the very next Exercise, however, that On the Primitive
Moisture, the last Exercise of Harvey's treatise
On Generation, we come suddenly upon a reason why
"the powers of the elements" must have seemed to
him something to be treated rather as a convenient
form of words than as a serious doctrine, despite his
respectful argument just quoted. Speaking of the
"primitive moisture," the great observer says that he
sees in the hen's egg that out of that "crystalline colliquament,"
that "simplest body" alone, all the parts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
of the embryo are made and increased;<a name="FNanchor_355_355" id="FNanchor_355_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a> and proceeds
bluntly to question the reality of the elements,
"namely, the fire, air, water, and earth of Empedocles
and Aristotle; or the salt, sulphur, and mercury of the
chemists; or the atoms of Democritus."<a name="FNanchor_356_356" id="FNanchor_356_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a> Harvey
says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Therefore, the so-called elements do not exist prior to whatever
is generated or arises; but rather are subsequent thereto, being
remains rather than origins. Not even Aristotle himself, nor
any one else, has ever demonstrated that elements exist separately
in nature, or give rise to bodies which consist of parts similar one
to another."<a name="FNanchor_357_357" id="FNanchor_357_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="noind">Almost immediately after this tug at the foundations
of the Aristotelian universe, Harvey brings his treatise
On Generation to an end.</p>

<p>The admirable feature of Harvey's brief last-published
discussion of the circulating blood is this, that
the aged veteran ever strikes vigorous blows for observation,
for the use of the senses, in the search for truth.
But we have seen already that by his arm, as by another's,
the blows are delivered both for better and for
worse. Rightly does he drive out of court the spirits
"ethereal and elemental" which no man can demonstrate.
Wrongly does he discredit the real complexity
of that humor, to the eye so simple and crystal-clear,
out of which he believes all the diverse parts of the
living bird to be developed. In Harvey's present
polemic we find no new appeal to nature; he vindicates
the justice of his former appeals and maintains with
vigor the doctrines already familiar to us, that the
blood is the principal part of the body, is itself the innate
heat, and is the seat of the soul. This relation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
blood and soul he reaffirms very impressively in this,
his final public utterance; a most important passage
of which, about the presence of the soul in the blood,
has been embodied in the chapter on that subject of the
present paper.<a name="FNanchor_358_358" id="FNanchor_358_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a></p>

<p>But evidently the main purpose of his polemical
Exercise on the Innate Heat is to cast out of the blood
the futile spirits which obscure the real relation of
that heat to the circulating blood; and so to defend
the thesis best set forth in the following words of his
own:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In truth, the blood alone is the innate warmth, or the
first born psychical heat; as is proved excellently well by our
observations of the generation of animals, especially of the
chick in the egg; so that it were superfluous to multiply entities....<a name="FNanchor_359_359" id="FNanchor_359_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a>
What need, then, is there, say I, of that foreign
guest, ethereal heat, since all can be accomplished by the blood,
even as by it?"<a name="FNanchor_360_360" id="FNanchor_360_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Harvey has expelled from the blood the mythical
spirits which had stood in the way of the direct identification
of the blood with the innate heat. But how
does he interpret the famous words of Aristotle which
he quotes, and declares not to have been "rightly interpreted"
by the champions of ethereal spirits?
When we seek an answer to this question, we do not
find the veteran discoverer at his best. The ancient
philosopher surely would have been as much surprised
at Harvey's interpretation of his words as at any use
of them made by Scaliger or Fernelius. We have seen
that Harvey follows up his quotation from Aristotle
by promptly applying its language, literally or by paraphrase,
to the innate heat and the blood.<a name="FNanchor_361_361" id="FNanchor_361_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a> Emphatic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
are the words which immediately follow the words of
Aristotle. Harvey says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I, too, would say the same, for my part, of the innate heat and
the blood, to wit: that it is not fire and does not take its origin
from fire, but is associated with another body and that more
divine."</p></blockquote>

<p class="noind">This denial he soon repeats, adding the words: "and
this is taught excellently well by our observations."</p>

<p>According to Aristotle the soul in the semen is associated
with a body diviner than the four lower elements,
viz.: the generative heat, an analogue of the element
of the stars, which analogue resides in spirits, <i>i.e.</i>, in
hot vapor within bubbles of seminal foam. In the case
of the blood, according to Harvey, it is the heat itself,
the innate heat <em>alias</em> the blood, which is associated
with "another body and that more divine," and Harvey,
having denied the reality of the spirits, uses the word
"spirits" as equivalent to "some power" in the blood,
which power is "very conspicuous in the nourishing and
preserving of the several parts of an animal." In the
spirits, so understood, and the blood, dwells the soul;
and it is the soul itself which Harvey states to be "a
nature analogous [<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">respondens</i> not <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">proportione respondens</i>]
to the element of the stars." Even as the word
"spirits" has become, in effect, a label for powers of
the blood, so the analogue of the ether becomes, in
effect, a pious epithet applied to the soul; and only to
the soul itself can Harvey have referred as "another
body and that more divine." In the next page to the
passage now under discussion he says:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The blood, therefore, is spirits, because of its extraordinary
virtues and powers. It is also celestial, inasmuch as in the spirits
aforesaid is lodged a nature, the soul, to wit, which is analogous
to the element of the stars; something, that is, analogous to heaven,
the instrument of heaven, vicarious of heaven....<a name="FNanchor_362_362" id="FNanchor_362_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a> The heat
of the blood is psychical, inasmuch as it is governed in its operations
by the soul;<a name="FNanchor_363_363" id="FNanchor_363_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a> it is also celestial, because subservient to heaven;
and divine, because the instrument of God, the best and greatest....<a name="FNanchor_364_364" id="FNanchor_364_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a>
The lower world, according to Aristotle, is so connected with
the courses on high that all its motives and changes seem to take
thence their origin and to be governed thence.<a name="FNanchor_365_365" id="FNanchor_365_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a> Truly, in that
world which the Greeks called the 'Cosmos' from the beauty of
its order,<a name="FNanchor_366_366" id="FNanchor_366_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a> lower and corruptible things are subject to other higher
and incorruptible things; but all are beneath the highest, the omnipotent
and eternal Creator, and obey Him."<a name="FNanchor_367_367" id="FNanchor_367_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>It is obvious that, although Harvey in dealing with
the blood does not forego the use of the phrases used
by the ancient master in dealing with the semen,
nevertheless, the entities recognized by Harvey are
not only fewer than those of Aristotle, but are differently
disposed within the draperies of Aristotelian
language. Harvey's entities are simply the innate
heat <em>alias</em> the blood, and the soul which dwells therein;
but he sincerely takes himself to be an interpreter of
Aristotle's words, as appears a second time from an
echo of those words which we meet in an earlier Exercise
of Harvey's treatise On Generation. Here, pleading
that it is true that the soul is in the blood,
Harvey refers to Aristotle by name and immediately
says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Indeed, if he is constrained by the truth to acknowledge that
there is a soul in an egg, even in a wind-egg;<a name="FNanchor_368_368" id="FNanchor_368_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a> and that in the
semen and the blood also there is found something which is divine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
and analogous to the element of the stars and is vicarious of the
omnipotent Creator; and if certain of the modems truly say," etc.,
etc.<a name="FNanchor_369_369" id="FNanchor_369_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="noind">These zealous words show Harvey drawn into statements
by no means warranted by the text of Aristotle.
We have seen that the Aristotelian heaven was uncreated;<a name="FNanchor_370_370" id="FNanchor_370_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a>
and, whatever Harvey in his day may have
thought, no "omnipotent Creator" is revealed by more
modern study of the Aristotelian philosophy. Whatever
inferences Harvey may have drawn from Aristotle's
words, Aristotle does not "acknowledge"<a name="FNanchor_371_371" id="FNanchor_371_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a> that the
analogue of the ether exists in the blood. Moreover,
when in Harvey's Exercise On the Innate Heat that
analogue of the element of the stars which Aristotle associated
with the soul is identified by Harvey with the
soul itself, the change is almost as great as if one should
declare that protoplasm is life, instead of styling it with
Huxley "the physical basis of life." In a third Exercise
of the treatise On Generation, the earliest of the three,
Harvey had dealt in a better and more characteristic
way with the analogue of the ether; though here, too, his
exposition gives no accurate idea of Aristotle's doctrine.
In discussing Aristotle's opinion as to how the semen of
the cock causes the formation of the embryo Harvey
says of Aristotle:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Indeed, where he appears to settle and determine with certainty
what that may be in whatsoever seed, whether of plants or
of animals, which renders the same fruitful, he rejects heat and fire
as unfit for the work, but does not give recognition to any similar
faculty, nor yet discover in the seed aught suitable for that duty;
but is forced to admit something incorporeal, and coming from
without, which shall act with understanding and foresight (like art
or mind) to form the f&oelig;tus, and therein shall establish and order<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
all things to a purpose and for the better. He betakes himself, I
say, to something obscure and to us unknown, 'spirits included in
the semen and in foaminess, and in the spirits the nature which is
analogous to the element of the stars.' But what that may be he
has nowhere taught us."<a name="FNanchor_372_372" id="FNanchor_372_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>We have found that Aristotle describes "the element
of the stars" as a "body,"<a name="FNanchor_373_373" id="FNanchor_373_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a> and that in the passage
about the semen which Harvey quotes Aristotle expressly
applies the same term, "body," to the analogue
of the element of the stars.<a name="FNanchor_374_374" id="FNanchor_374_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a> Yet to this analogue
Harvey seems to refer as "something incorporeal"
in his last-quoted words, which tend to confound it
with soul. Harvey agrees with Aristotle, however, in
calling fire a "body";<a name="FNanchor_375_375" id="FNanchor_375_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a> and where in his Exercise On
the Innate Heat he extols at some length<a name="FNanchor_376_376" id="FNanchor_376_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a> fire, air and
water in motion as flame, wind and flood, he also sets
forth how they each claim the title of spirits "by virtue
of their movement and perpetual flux,"<a name="FNanchor_377_377" id="FNanchor_377_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a> and says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"These three, therefore, in so far as they acquire a certain life,
appear to act beyond the powers of the elements and to have a
share<a name="FNanchor_378_378" id="FNanchor_378_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a> of another and diviner body; wherefore they were reckoned
among the deities by the heathen. For that of which the
outcome is some extraordinary work, exceeding the bare faculties
of the elements, that same they held to proceed from some diviner
agent; as though it were one and the same to act beyond the powers
of the elements and to have a share of another and diviner body&mdash;diviner,
because it does not derive its origin from the elements."<a name="FNanchor_379_379" id="FNanchor_379_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Nowhere but in the third chapter of the second book
of Aristotle's treatise On Generation does he refer to
the analogue of the ether; and the complete text of this
chapter&mdash;rugged, here and there, especially in Gaza's
Latin translation&mdash;may help us perhaps to account<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
for some of Harvey's efforts at exposition.<a name="FNanchor_380_380" id="FNanchor_380_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a> But when
these and his reports of his predecessor's doctrines are
compared with the words of Aristotle, Harvey and
those other biologists of the Renaissance seem like
sturdy children reaching forward in the dust, each
still clasping a finger of the strong old father who strides
among them.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<h3>THE INNATE HEAT NOT DERIVED FROM ELEMENTAL FIRE</h3>


<p>So Harvey denies the doctrine falsely based upon
Aristotle's words, the doctrine of the ethereal nature
of the innate heat; but he affirms and adopts as his
own the Aristotelian distinction between the heat which
is sterile and the heat which gives life. This weighty
affirmation obliges us who study Harvey to examine
this impressive distinction further.<a name="FNanchor_381_381" id="FNanchor_381_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a></p>

<p>Aristotle says, we remember: "The heat in animals
is not fire and does not take its origin from fire." We
remember also that Harvey says: "I, too, would say
the same, for my part, of the innate heat and the blood,
to wit: that it is not fire and does not take its origin
from fire." This doctrine is based by both Aristotle
and Harvey upon observation; and Aristotle's argument
is contained in the passage which Harvey quotes,
a passage obscure in the Latin and rugged in the Greek.
Briefly, Aristotle's argument is this: Observation shows
that fire is sterile, but that the heat of the sun is generative
and the heat of animals likewise; therefore, the heat
of animals is not fire. Harvey declares that this same
conclusion "is taught excellently well" by his observations
also&mdash;by which he does not expressly say. That
Aristotle, in drawing the distinction aforesaid between
the heat of fire and the heat of the sun, was playing at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
hide and seek with a great truth of biology, would soon
be apparent to whosoever should take a flourishing
green plant from a window warmed by sunshine and
try to make the same plant flourish in a dark room
warmed by a hidden fire.</p>

<p>At this point let us scan further the words of Aristotle
which Harvey has quoted.<a href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a> Aristotle says:<a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a>&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"For there exists in the semen of all [animals] that which makes
their semen generative, the so-called heat. Yet this is not fire,
nor any such power, but the spirits<a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> included in the semen and in
foaminess, and in the spirits the nature which is analogous to the
element of the stars.<a name="FNanchor_320_320" id="FNanchor_320_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a> Wherefore fire generates no animal, nor does
anything [animal] appear in process of formation in that, whether
moist or dry, which is undergoing the action of fire;<a href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a> whereas the
heat of the sun and that of animals&mdash;not only that [which acts]
through the semen,<a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> but also, should there occur some excretion of a
different nature<a href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a>&mdash;even this, too, possesses a life-giving principle.
It is patent, then, from such [facts] as these that the heat in animals
is not fire and does not take its origin from fire."<a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="noind">In this passage a forcible presentment is made of the
sterilizing power of fire, and elsewhere we are told by
Aristotle that "only in earth and in water are there
animals; there are none in air and in fire."<a name="FNanchor_382_382" id="FNanchor_382_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a> That
by the word "fire" we are to understand elemental heat
of greater or less intensity is sufficiently shown perhaps
by the context. But no doubt will linger if we glance
at two lines from another treatise in which, referring
expressly to the four elements, Aristotle speaks of
earth, water, air, and "what as a matter of custom we
call 'fire' but it is not fire; for fire is an excess, a boiling,
as it were, of heat."<a name="FNanchor_383_383" id="FNanchor_383_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a></p>

<p>Harvey, looking askance as he did at the four ancient
elements and even bluntly questioning the elementary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
constitution of matter, felt himself free to reduce the
analogue of the ether to a pious epithet, and yet to
accept with emphasis the Aristotelian doctrine that the
heat of animals "is not fire." At the end of his Exercise
On the Primitive Moisture he says: "Nor, lastly,
do we find that anything is naturally generated out of
fire, as out of something capable of mixture, and the
thing is perhaps impossible." Here, however, he is not
dealing merely with the generation of living beings, but
with a subject deeper yet, the possibility of fire acting
as an element at all.<a name="FNanchor_384_384" id="FNanchor_384_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a></p>

<p>The drift of those sentences which Harvey quotes is
lighted up, better perhaps than by any modern commentary,
by a passage of Cicero's treatise On the Nature
of the Gods, a treatise mentioned by Harvey in
his lecture notes,<a name="FNanchor_385_385" id="FNanchor_385_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a> as we have seen. In the orator's
lucid Latin we may read what purports to be a quotation
from the Greek philosopher Cleanthes, who was a child
when Aristotle died in 322 <small>B.C.</small>, and who became the
second head of the Stoic school, the powerful younger
rival of the school of Aristotle. Let us listen to the
Roman stoic of 45 or 44 <small>B.C.</small>, who is set up by Cicero
to quote and expound Cleanthes as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Cleanthes says: 'Since the sun is fiery and is nourished by
the humors of Ocean (seeing that no fire can last without some kind
of food), therefore, the sun must needs be similar either to the fire
which we use and apply in our daily life, or to that fire which is
contained in the bodies of animate beings. But this fire of ours,
which is requisite for the uses of life, is the destroyer and consumer
of all things, and wheresoever it has made its way disturbs and
dissipates everything; whereas that fire of the body is vital and
salutary and by it everything is preserved, nourished, increased,
sustained, and endowed with sense.' Cleanthes denies, therefore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
that it is doubtful to which of these two fires the sun is similar,
seeing that the sun likewise makes all things flourish and ripen,
each after its kind. Wherefore, since the sun's fire is similar to
those fires which exist in the bodies of animate beings, the sun, too,
must be an animate being and, indeed, the rest of the stars that
arise in the celestial ardor which is named ether or heaven."<a name="FNanchor_386_386" id="FNanchor_386_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="noind">Unlike Aristotle, Cicero's stoic admits that the sun and
even the heavenly ether are fire. But we see him to
be no less impressed than Aristotle by the difference
between the killing heat of flame and the life-giving
heat of heaven and of living things. It is interesting
to find this difference expressly given as a reason for
believing the heavenly bodies to be alive; and one
wonders whether this difference may not have had
some share in convincing Aristotle that the ether is an
element distinct from fire and the other three elements,
and more exalted than they. It must be said, however,
that Aristotle's habitual use of language about "the
heat contained in animals" prepares us ill for the momentous
distinction drawn by him between this and
elemental heat.</p>

<p>We have found him speaking of "the soul being, as it
were, afire" within the heart;<a name="FNanchor_387_387" id="FNanchor_387_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a> and he says also that
"the concoction through which nutrition takes place in
animals does not go on either in the absence of soul or
in the absence of heat, seeing that everything is done
by fire."<a name="FNanchor_388_388" id="FNanchor_388_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a> Moreover, there is in his treatise On Soul
a passage deserving immediate quotation, no less as a
picture of the nascent stage of biological thought, than
as showing a phase of Aristotelian doctrine contrasting
with the doctrine of the analogue of the ether. He
says:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"By some the nature of fire is held to be quite simply the cause
of nutrition and growth; for fire alone among bodies or elements is
seen being nourished and growing; wherefore one might assume it
to be that which does the work both in plants and in animals. It
is, in a way, the contributing cause<a name="FNanchor_389_389" id="FNanchor_389_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a> but not the cause in the
simple sense, the soul rather being that; for the growth of fire is
limitless, so long as there are combustibles, but in the case of all
natural organisms<a name="FNanchor_390_390" id="FNanchor_390_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a> there is a limit to size and growth, and a rationale<a name="FNanchor_391_391" id="FNanchor_391_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a>
thereof; these things depending upon the soul, not upon
fire, and upon reason rather than upon matter."<a name="FNanchor_392_392" id="FNanchor_392_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Nevertheless, in spite of seeming inconsistencies, we
find Aristotle declaring that the heat of fire sterilizes,
but the heat of the sun and of animals gives life.
Moreover, when he tells us in the passage quoted by
Harvey<a name="FNanchor_393_393" id="FNanchor_393_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a> that not only the heat of the sun and of
semen, but also the heat of other animal excretions possesses
a "life-giving principle," the words appear to
suggest not merely generation without sex, but the
spontaneous generation either of parasites within the
animal body, or of living things in matters cast off
from it. We seem to be confronted with the far-reaching
thought that there is in the world a life-giving
principle by which, when associated with soul, matter
is quickened in ways of which sexual generation is only
one; and that this principle is generative heat, streaming
from the sun or transmitted by the male in coition,
and, thereafter, innate in the resulting creature and
shared by the humors thereof. The fact must always
have been recognized that in some way the existence
of living things on earth depends upon the sun. On the
other hand, no modern methods fortified Aristotle's
intelligence against spontaneous generation, which he
accepted as a matter of course and called "automatic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
generation," even asserting that eels and some other
fishes originate in this way.<a name="FNanchor_394_394" id="FNanchor_394_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a> Further statements of
his own shall show us now that the sun in its orbit dominates
the changes upon and above the earth and is the
giver of life, whether imparted by sexual intercourse or
otherwise. Then Harvey shall repeat the lesson and
thus help us to understand his declaration regarding the
innate heat and the blood, to wit: that it "is not fire
and does not take its origin from fire."</p>

<p>Aristotle refers to a region beneath the celestial
spheres, which region he calls "the first in proximity
to the earth," or "the region common to water and air."
He says of the events therein:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Of these the efficient<a name="FNanchor_395_395" id="FNanchor_395_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a> cause and ruler and first origin is the
circle of the sun's course, which, it is evident, produces separation
and combination by its approach or withdrawal and is the cause of
generation and corruption."<a name="FNanchor_396_396" id="FNanchor_396_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="noind">These last words are used in a large sense to mean the
formation and disintegration of whatever is composed
of the four elements.</p>

<p>But the annual circuit of the sun does more than
bring to pass the rhythmic changes of the seasons with
their effects upon man's environment. To the sun's
circuit man owes his life. Aristotle has said to us
already: "Man and the sun generate man," in words
which have no biological context.<a href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a> He does better
when he enumerates among the "causes" of a man
these three: his father, the sun, and "the oblique
circle," <i>i.e.</i>, the ecliptic. These he styles "efficient<a name="FNanchor_397_397" id="FNanchor_397_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a>
causes" of man,<a name="FNanchor_398_398" id="FNanchor_398_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a> as we have heard him style "the
circle of the sun's course" the "efficient cause" of the
mighty changes in inanimate things. We learn in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
what sense a father is the "efficient cause" of his offspring
when Aristotle says: "The female always
provides the matter, while the male provides that which
fashions it";<a name="FNanchor_399_399" id="FNanchor_399_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a> and when we are told that this matter
provided by the female "is quickened by the principle
derived from the male, which thus perfects the
animal";<a name="FNanchor_400_400" id="FNanchor_400_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a> "the animal" meaning the product of
conception. "The body," says Aristotle further, "is
from the female, but the soul from the male."<a name="FNanchor_401_401" id="FNanchor_401_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a> For
although he says elsewhere that "Genesis is the first
obtaining in heat of a share of nutritive soul, and life
is the tarrying thereof";<a name="FNanchor_402_402" id="FNanchor_402_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a> although he concedes a
share of this lowest kind of soul to wind-eggs, to plants,
and to the humblest things which live; nevertheless,
he holds that, where the sexes are divided, the indispensable
"sensory soul" which distinguishes the animal
from the plant is derived from the male parent only.<a name="FNanchor_403_403" id="FNanchor_403_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a>
So the seminal fluid and the solar rays are coupled together
as "efficient causes" of man; and thus the
moving sun is made responsible, by what chain of
causation we are not told expressly, for the results of
sexual generation.</p>

<p>From this we may turn now to other forms of generation
in the light of the following prodigious analogy.
Aristotle says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"We call 'male' an animal which engenders within another,
and 'female' one which engenders within itself; and, therefore,
in the case of the universe the earth's nature is held to be female
and maternal, while heaven and the sun and other such are called
engenderers and fathers."<a name="FNanchor_404_404" id="FNanchor_404_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="noind">Next, after these sweeping generalities, let us peruse Aristotle's
account of spontaneous generation. He says:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Animals and plants arise in earth and in moisture, because in
earth there is water and in water there is air,<a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> and in all air there is
psychical heat; so that in a certain sense all things are full of soul.
Therefore, when once inclusion of this<a name="FNanchor_405_405" id="FNanchor_405_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a> has taken place, an individual
is quickly formed.<a name="FNanchor_406_406" id="FNanchor_406_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a> Inclusion takes place and a kind of
foam-bubble arises, produced by the heating of moisture which has
body<a name="FNanchor_407_407" id="FNanchor_407_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a> of its own."<a name="FNanchor_408_408" id="FNanchor_408_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="noind">The last expression in this passage evidently means
moisture which is charged with earthy matter in solution;
for Aristotle says in the same treatise that seawater
"has much more body" than drinking-water.<a name="FNanchor_409_409" id="FNanchor_409_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a>
Still speaking of spontaneous generation he says a
little further on:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Whoever would inquire aright should ask: What product in
such cases answers to that material principle which in the female is
a certain animal excretion,<a name="FNanchor_410_410" id="FNanchor_410_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a> potentially similar to what it came
from? That excretion is quickened by the principle derived from
the male, which thus perfects the animal. In the present case
what should be likened to that excretion, and whence and what is
the quickening principle which answers to the principle from the
male? Now we must assume that, even in animals which procreate,
the heat within the animal<a name="FNanchor_411_411" id="FNanchor_411_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a> separates and concocts, and thus
makes out of the nourishment which enters the animal the excretion
which is the beginning of the embryo. Such is the case with
plants likewise; although in these and in some animals there is
no need of the principle imparted by the male, for this they have
within and mingled with themselves; whereas in most animals the
excretion aforesaid stands in need of that principle. The nourishment
of some is water and earth, that of others is derived from
water and earth; so that what the heat in animals<a name="FNanchor_412_412" id="FNanchor_412_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a> prepares out
of their nourishment, the heat of the season in the circumambient
air combines by concoction out of the sea and the earth, and puts
together.<a name="FNanchor_413_413" id="FNanchor_413_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a> But so much of the psychical principle as is included
or separated within the air<a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> constructs and quickens<a name="FNanchor_414_414" id="FNanchor_414_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_414_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a> the embryo.
In like manner are put together such plants as arise by
spontaneous generation."<a name="FNanchor_415_415" id="FNanchor_415_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>The doctrine that in sexual generation the semen
furnishes soul and generative heat but none of the matter<a name="FNanchor_416_416" id="FNanchor_416_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a>
of which the embryo consists, renders logical the
view, which Aristotle would seem to hold, that it is
soul from the air and generative heat from the sun which
in spontaneous generation represent the derivatives
from the male.<a name="FNanchor_417_417" id="FNanchor_417_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a> The presence about us of "the psychical
principle," thus diffused, may well seem startling
to a modern biologist; but we may remind ourselves
that in ancient times many believed the soul to be conveyed
by the air into even the higher animals; even
into man himself, even man's "understanding" reaching
him thus.<a name="FNanchor_418_418" id="FNanchor_418_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a> Indeed, not only the words "<i>pneuma</i>"
and "<i>spiritus</i>," as we have learned, but also the Greek
and Latin words for "soul," viz.: "<i>psyche</i>" and
"<i>anima</i>," meant originally simply "breath." Let us
recall the words of scripture, which seem so vivid to one
who watches the change in a new-born child as the first
breath is taken: "And the Lord God formed man of
the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils
the breath of life; and man became a living soul."<a name="FNanchor_419_419" id="FNanchor_419_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a></p>

<p>That the soul enters with the breath is, however,
expressly denied by Aristotle. Conceding a share
of soul to every living thing he points out quite simply
that there are animals which do not breathe at all, to
say nothing of plants.<a name="FNanchor_420_420" id="FNanchor_420_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a> Clearly, the doctrine which
he rejects would be hard to reconcile with his theory of
sexual generation, according to which theory the sensory
soul, and in man even the divine intellectual
soul, is potential in the semen and imparted thereby
to the product of conception.<a name="FNanchor_421_421" id="FNanchor_421_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a> Indeed, there is a
chapter of Aristotle's treatise On Soul in which he even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
seems to argue against the presence of soul in the air,
in a polemic directed against those who believe the soul
to be "composed of the elements."<a name="FNanchor_422_422" id="FNanchor_422_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_422_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a> In this polemic
he is the subtle philosopher; but in his statements
about generation he seems more the biologist; for in
these his thought, if not more ripe, appears to be less
concerned with disputation than with phenomena and
the interpretation thereof.</p>

<p>The generation of living things is but generation
still, whether it be sexual or spontaneous; and the
modern student of general physiology may trace further
parallels of thought in Aristotle's account of spontaneous
generation and in those words of his about the
semen which Harvey quotes and we have studied.
That living rudiment, spontaneously generated, which
consists of a foam-bubble whose film of earth and water
was formed by the heat of the sun and includes air
charged with generative heat associated with soul&mdash;surely
that reminds one of the foamy semen, and of
"the spirits included in the semen and in foaminess,"
and of that within the spirits "which makes semen
generative, the so-called heat," the "nature which is
analogous to the element of the stars," which nature is
derived from the male parent and is associated with the
soul potential in the semen. In the Greek text of
Aristotle one and the same word, "<i>pneuma</i>" is used
to express both the air in the foam-bubbles of spontaneous
generation, and the vapor in the foam-bubbles
of the semen. In translation "<i>pneuma</i>" must be
rendered "spirits" in the case of the semen, and the
verbal identity is lost which, by reason of the very
vagueness of the Greek word, helps to mark the parallelism<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
of thought. It is with <i>pneuma</i>, spirits, that the
testicles and breasts are swollen at the advent of puberty,<a name="FNanchor_423_423" id="FNanchor_423_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a>
according to Aristotle; and with the presence
of <i>pneuma</i> he connects the pleasure of the sexual act.<a name="FNanchor_424_424" id="FNanchor_424_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a>
We have found him laying stress upon the fact that
"the nature of semen is foamy"&mdash;that its "generative
medium ἡ γονή is foam": and he tells of the spontaneous
generation of certain shellfish in a place where
there is "foamy mud."<a name="FNanchor_425_425" id="FNanchor_425_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a> When he obscurely says
that in the semen "the <i>pneuma</i> included in the semen
and in foaminess"<a name="FNanchor_426_426" id="FNanchor_426_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a> is the vehicle of the generative
heat, does not the turn of phrase indicate that Aristotle's
thought is ranging far, that he is thinking not only of
the foam of the semen but of other widely different
kinds of prolific foam as well? Does he not seem to
think that, in general, the power of bringing matter to
life as a new individual dwells typically in a bubble
representing earth, water, and air, and charged with
soul and with generative heat, for the presence of
which the sun is responsible, heat other than that
of elemental fire?<a href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a> It is not fanciful&mdash;for Aristotle
himself, we remember, has done so incidentally&mdash;to
connect such speculation with the ancient
myth of Aphrodite, the goddess of love, who sprang
from the foam which had risen upon the sea, about
the immortal genitals of Uranus, which had been
severed and cast therein; Uranus being the heavens
personified.<a name="FNanchor_427_427" id="FNanchor_427_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a></p>

<p>Before the time of Aristotle important thinkers had
held the heavenly bodies, and even the heavens themselves,
to be fire;<a name="FNanchor_428_428" id="FNanchor_428_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a> and we have seen that after his
time Cleanthes did the same, simply setting apart the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
generative fire from the destructive. Aristotle denied
that the sun is fire, though he could not have denied
that its radiant generative heat produces no different
sensation from that of sterile fire kindled upon earth.
He did not identify the sun's heat with ether, the "body
on high," though he styled the heat of the semen a
"body" analogous to the ether. How then did Aristotle
obtain heat from the ethereal sun? The point
is crucial and he met it; but in so doing he revealed a
very weak place in his towering fabric of speculation.
In his treatise On Heaven, speaking of the heavenly
bodies, he says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The heat and light from these arise from the friction which the
air undergoes by reason of their course. For it is the nature of
motion to fire even wood and stone and steel."</p></blockquote>

<p class="noind">He then speaks of projectiles, and says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"These, then, are heated because borne onward in air which becomes
fire from the shock of the motion. But each of the bodies
on high is borne onward in its sphere, so that they are not fired;
while the air, being beneath the sphere of the circling body,<a name="FNanchor_429_429" id="FNanchor_429_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a> is
heated of necessity as this [body] is borne onward, and mainly
where the sun is set in place. Therefore, when the sun approaches
and rises and is above us, heat is generated. Be it said, then, of the
heavenly bodies, that neither are they fiery nor are they borne on
in fire."<a name="FNanchor_430_430" id="FNanchor_430_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="noind">In his Meteorology Aristotle boldly says: "The sun,
which is held to be especially hot, appears white, but
not to be like fire."<a name="FNanchor_431_431" id="FNanchor_431_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a></p>

<p>Hardy thinker as he is, however, Aristotle nowhere
undertakes to tell how the heat of friction between the
air and the circling "first element" on high becomes
generative, as opposed to the heat of friction between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
the air and a projectile composed of the lower elements.
As to this the Aristotle who deals with the heavens does
not strike hands with Aristotle the biologist; nor is
light thrown by its author on the Aristotelian passage
quoted by Harvey, in which alone does the generative
heat of animals figure as "the nature which is analogous
to the elements of the stars";<a name="FNanchor_432_432" id="FNanchor_432_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a> nor yet does the
Aristotelian dictum that "Man and the sun generate
man"<a href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a> remain other than a great truth which awaits
elucidation.</p>

<p>More than nineteen centuries after Aristotle's death
Harvey published the following, in his treatise On
Generation:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Thus the sun and man, that is, the sun through man as an instrument,
generate. In the same way the Father of all and the
cock generate the egg and the chick derived from the egg; namely,
by means of the perpetual approach and withdrawal of the sun,
which by the will of divine authority, or by fate if you choose, serves
for the generation of all things.</p>

<p>"Our conclusion, then, is that the male, although a prior and more
important efficient cause than the female, is only an instrumental
efficient cause; that he, no less than the female, receives his
fecundity or generative power from the approaching sun; and
that, accordingly, the art and providence which we discern in his
works proceed not from himself but from God."<a name="FNanchor_433_433" id="FNanchor_433_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_433_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="noind">Two pages farther on Harvey says, again:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In fact, what the cock confers upon the egg to make it no
longer a wind-egg but prolific, is the same that is bestowed by the
summer fervor of the sun upon vegetable fruits, that they may
reach maturity, and their seeds, fecundity; and the same that
imparts fecundity to beings that arise spontaneously<a name="FNanchor_434_434" id="FNanchor_434_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_434_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a> and that
produces caterpillars out of worms, chrysalides out of caterpillars,
out of chrysalides, butterflies, flies, bees, and the rest."<a name="FNanchor_435_435" id="FNanchor_435_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_435_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p class="noind">In a later Exercise of the same treatise Harvey says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"As I have said, the product of conception in viviparous creatures
is analogous to the seed and fruit of plants; as also is the egg
in the ovipara; in creatures which come into existence spontaneously,
the worm;<a name="FNanchor_436_436" id="FNanchor_436_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_436_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a> or some bubble of confined moisture<a name="FNanchor_437_437" id="FNanchor_437_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_437_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a> pregnant
with vital heat. In all of the foregoing exists that which is
the same in all, that in virtue of which they are called with truth
seeds; that, namely, out of which and by which, preëxisting as
matter, artificer, and instrument, every animal is in the first instance
made and comes into existence."<a name="FNanchor_438_438" id="FNanchor_438_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_438_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Despite emphatic denials of Aristotelian doctrine
which Harvey freely makes in his treatise On Generation,
the Aristotelian flavor of the foregoing passages is
obvious. It is not easy to make out from Harvey's
writings the exact nature of his views as to spontaneous
generation. He sometimes seems to assume the truth
thereof; but it is by no means certain that he believed
in it in the same simple sense in which it had been
accepted by Aristotle.<a name="FNanchor_439_439" id="FNanchor_439_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_439_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a> Nothing, however, can be
clearer than this: that, though for Harvey the "innate
heat" is not ethereal spirits nor even an analogue of the
ether, but is simply identical with the living blood;
nevertheless, for him as emphatically as for Aristotle
the "heat in animals" which "is not fire and does not
take its origin from fire," derives its origin from the
solar ray.</p>

<p>To Harvey, the lifelong thinker upon the meaning
of the circulation, the prodigious history of generation
was but continued in the history of the blood, with
which he had identified the "innate heat" and which he
saw appear and live, before all other parts, in the minute
first rudiment of the embryo. We have seen him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
pondering the cycle wherein unending life is transmitted
from egg to fowl and from fowl to egg beneath the sun's
life-giving rays. So now shall we see him pondering a
cycle of life wherein, from generation to generation, the
circulating blood takes over and exercises the generative
powers of the semen from which it is derived, and
transmits them in turn to the semen evolved out of
itself. He says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Further, since we have just seen the study of the semen to be
so difficult; that is to say, the way in which the structure of the
body is built up by the semen with foresight, art, and divine intelligence;
why should we not equally admire the excellent nature of
the blood, and make the same reflections upon it as upon the semen?
Especially since the semen itself is made of blood,<a name="FNanchor_440_440" id="FNanchor_440_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_440_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a> as is proved
in the case of the egg; and since the whole body is seen not only
to take origin from the blood as from a generative part, but also to
owe its preservation to the same."<a name="FNanchor_441_441" id="FNanchor_441_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_441_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>To this same theme Harvey returns in his Exercise
On the Innate Heat near the end of his treatise On
Generation, saying:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The blood, too, acts in like manner above the powers of the elements,
because, when it has come into existence as the first generated
part and the innate heat, as is brought to pass in the semen
and spirits, the blood constructs the remaining parts of the whole
body in order; and does so with the highest foresight and understanding,<a name="FNanchor_442_442" id="FNanchor_442_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_442_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a>
acting to a certain end and as though by some use of
reason.<a name="FNanchor_443_443" id="FNanchor_443_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_443_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a> Surely the blood does not accomplish these things because
it is composed of elements and draws its origin from fire, but
because by the grace of plastic power and vegetative soul it is made
the first generated heat and the immediate and fitting instrument
of life."<a name="FNanchor_444_444" id="FNanchor_444_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_444_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a></p></blockquote>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<h3>THE CIRCULATION OF THE BLOOD AND THE CIRCULATION
OF THE HEAVENS</h3>


<p>The discoverer of the circulation would have been
no fit pupil of Aristotle if he had limited his ken to the
microcosm; nor were such limitations common in an
age when astrology was not so far out of countenance
as now. We have found Harvey discussing "the
element of the stars" and reverently affirming the
dependence of all life upon the sun as well as upon its
Creator. We have found him also, in dealing with
the powers of the blood, affirming that "lower and
corruptible things are subject to other higher and incorruptible
things," and in that connection paraphrasing
a passage in which Aristotle deals with "the Cosmos
which is about the earth." Of this&mdash;that is, of the
sum of things between our globe and the moon's
sphere&mdash;the ancient philosopher says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Of necessity it is conjoined, in a way, with the courses on high,
so that its entire power is governed thence; for that which originates
motion in everything must be recognized as first cause."<a name="FNanchor_445_445" id="FNanchor_445_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_445_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="noind">In "the courses on high" the divine living existences of
heaven circulated forever, ruling the lower Cosmos as
cycle succeeded cycle in endless series and the seasons
endlessly recurred. In a few pregnant words Aristotle
had dealt with the results of this Cosmic circulation, as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"There is said to be a circle in the affairs both of mankind and
of whatever else is possessed of natural motion and is subject to
generation and corruption."<a name="FNanchor_446_446" id="FNanchor_446_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_446_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>It was in Harvey's lifetime that this stupendous
circulation of the heavens "and all that is in them"
received its death stroke. Throughout Harvey's years
of study at Padua, Galileo had lectured there with great
acclaim; and after Harvey's return to London discovery
after discovery had followed Galileo's work with
the telescope, and had dealt blow after blow to the
ancient astronomy. The trial of Galileo had followed;
and he had died in 1642, nine years before the publication
of Harvey's work On Generation. Yet belief in
the ancient astronomy died far harder than belief in
the ancient physiology of the movement of the blood.
The ancient astronomy was based on the evidence of
every man's own eyes, and flattered human vanity with
the doctrine that the whole universe was centered upon
the globe of which the ordained possessor was the creature
made in the image of God. Milton had visited
Galileo, famous long before, near Florence in 1638;
but in the "Paradise Lost," published in 1667,<a name="FNanchor_447_447" id="FNanchor_447_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_447_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a> Milton
expressly treated the question between the ancients and
the followers of Copernicus as an open one, though
Copernicus had died in 1543. Indeed, we find Harvey
himself, seven years after Galileo's death, speaking of
"the reason why our knowledge of the heavenly bodies
is uncertain and conjectural";<a name="FNanchor_448_448" id="FNanchor_448_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_448_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a> and saying of opponents
of the circulation of the blood: "Nor do they find
it satisfactory to set up new systems, as in astronomy,
unless these explain all the phenomena."<a name="FNanchor_449_449" id="FNanchor_449_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_449_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a></p>

<p>It need not surprise us, therefore, to find Harvey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
writing as follows in 1628 in the very act of naming his
own great discovery:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I beg leave to call this motion circular in the same sense in
which Aristotle said that air<a name="FNanchor_450_450" id="FNanchor_450_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_450_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a> and rain imitate the circular motion
of the bodies on high.<a name="FNanchor_451_451" id="FNanchor_451_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_451_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a> For the earth, when wet and warmed by
the sun, gives off vapor; the vapors are borne upward and condensed
and, when condensed into rain, descend again and wet the
earth. Thus, too, generation here below and, in like manner, the
arising of tempests and meteors result from the circular motion of
the sun, his approach and recession."<a name="FNanchor_452_452" id="FNanchor_452_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_452_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>In 1651, nine years after the death of Galileo, in the
last words about the moving blood which Harvey published,
he drew a parallel between the circulation of the
microcosm and the mighty circulation of the macrocosm.
This parallel is drawn just before the end of his final
work, his treatise On Generation, in a passage of his
Exercise On the Innate Heat, in words which may
serve to sum up what has gone before. These words
shall be quoted without further comment and shall
bring our present study of Harvey to an end:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The following few points should be considered well by every
diligent mind, and so the fact becomes established more clearly, that
those remarkable virtues which learned men attribute to the spirits
and the innate heat are appropriate to the blood alone; to say
nothing of what is so wonderfully striking in the egg before aught of
the embryo has appeared, and in the perfect and developed embryo
also. To be sure, the blood, considered absolutely and by itself
outside the veins and regarded as consisting of elements<a name="FNanchor_453_453" id="FNanchor_453_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_453_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a> and as
composed of different parts,&mdash;some thin and serous, some thick and
solidified,&mdash;is termed 'cruor' and is possessed of very few virtues,
and those obscure. But the blood, when present within the veins
as a part of the body, a generative part, too, and endowed with soul,
being the soul's immediate instrument and primary seat&mdash;the blood,
seeming also to have a share of another diviner body and being suffused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
with divine heat, certainly acquires extraordinary powers,
and is analogous to the element of the stars. As spirits the blood
is the hearth, the Vesta,<a name="FNanchor_454_454" id="FNanchor_454_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_454_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a> the household deity, the innate heat,
the sun of the microcosm, the fire of Plato;<a name="FNanchor_455_455" id="FNanchor_455_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_455_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a> not because it shines,
burns, and destroys, like common fire, but because it preserves
and nourishes and increases its very self by its perpetual wandering
motion. Moreover, the blood deserves the name of spirits
because, primarily and before all other parts, it abounds in radical
moisture, that is, in the final and most immediate form of nourishment;
and the same fare wherewith the blood itself is nourished
is made ready by it and given out to all other parts while it is
coursing perpetually through the entire body. Indeed, the blood
nourishes, fosters, and keeps alive all the parts which it constructs
and adjoins to itself, even as the heavenly bodies above, especially
the sun and moon, impart life to what is below, while they continue
in perpetual circulation. Since, therefore, the blood acts beyond
the powers of the elements and is potent with those virtues aforesaid,
and also is the instrument of the supreme workman, no one
ever will give praise enough to its wonderful and divine faculties."<a name="FNanchor_456_456" id="FNanchor_456_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_456_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Let us end these studies by picturing to ourselves the
memorable figure of the small white-haired man ensconced
in one of his favorite nooks on the leads of his
brother's house, musing upon the mystery of the circulation,
and linking it with that of</p>

<div class="footnotes"><h3>NOTES:</h3>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> In the present paper frequent references will be made to the
writings of Harvey, Galen, Aristotle, and Hippocrates. Citations
from these authors will be made from the following editions:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
References to Harvey's finished writings will be made to two
editions, viz.: The Works of William Harvey, translated from the
Latin with a life of the author by R. Willis, M.D., London, 1847,
printed for the Sydenham Society, which will here be designated as
"Syd."; and Guilielmi Harveii Opera Omnia: A Collegio Medicorum
Londinensi Edita: 1766, which will be designated as "Op. Omn."
In the preparation of the text the present writer has used these
two editions and also the first editions of Exercitatio Anatomica
de Motu Cordis et Sanguinis in Animalibus, Frankfort, 1628, and
Exercitationes de Generatione Animalium, London, 1651. Willis's
translation of passages has been revised, often freely, where the
writer has judged this desirable; and sometimes the revision amounts
to a fresh translation. References to Harvey's lecture notes will be
made to Prelectiones Anatomiæ Universalis by William Harvey, edited
with an autotype reproduction of the original by a committee of the
Royal College of Physicians, London, 1886.
</p>
<p>
References to Galen's writings will be made to two editions,
viz.: Claudii Galeni Opera Omnia. Editionem curavit C. G. Kühn,
Leipsic, 1821-1833, which will be designated by the letters "Kn.";
and &OElig;uvres Anatomiques, Physiologíques et Medicáles de Galien,
Traduites avec Notes par C. Daremberg, Paris, 1854-1856, which will
be cited as "Dar." The former is the recognized working edition of
the Greek text of Galen; this is accompanied by a Latin translation,
to which is appended a serviceable Latin index. By the pages of
this edition the Greek text of Galen is commonly cited. None of the
treatises of Galen has been translated into English. Some of those
most interesting to physiologists may be read in the above French
translation of Daremberg. A critical edition of the Greek text of
Galen's treatise On the Doctrines of Hippocrates and Plato, Claudii
Galeni de Placitis Hippocratis et Platonis, with an amended Latin
translation by Johannes Müller, was published by Teubner, Leipsic,
1874; it will here be cited as "Mül."
</p>
<p>
References to Aristotle's writings will be made to Aristotelis
Opera: Edidit Academia Regia Borussica, Berlin, 1831-1870, which is
the commonly cited Greek text. Pages and lines of this edition will
always be found in the margin of a modern edition or translation.
The following works of Aristotle will be referred to in this paper:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
The Psychology and its appendices, viz.: the so-called "Lesser
Works on Natural Things (Parva Naturalia)." English translation by
W. A. Hammond, New York, 1902. The two last treatises of the Parva
Naturalia have also been translated by W. Ogle, M.D., London, 1897.
</p>
<p>
The History of Animals. English translation by R. Creswell. Bohn's
Classical Library. London, 1878.
</p>
<p>
On the Parts of Animals. English translation by W. Ogle, M.D.,
London, 1882.
</p>
<p>
On the Generation of Animals. There is no English translation. An
excellent German translation, with the Greek text, is that by Aubert
and Wimmer, Leipsic, 1860.
</p>
<p>
Physics. There is no English translation; Greek text and German
translation by C. Prantl, Leipsic, 1854.
</p>
<p>
On Heaven: On Generation and Corruption (In the Universe at Large).
There is no English translation; Greek text and German translation
by C. Prantl, Leipsic, 1857.
</p>
<p>
Meteorology. There is no English translation; French translation by
J. B. St. Hilaire, Paris, 1863.
</p>
<p>
Besides the foregoing, other treatises by Aristotle may be referred
to or cited briefly.
</p>
<p>
References to the Hippocratic writings will be made to &OElig;uvres
Complètes d'Hippocrate, traduction nouvelle, par É. Littré, Paris,
1839-1861, which will be designated as "Lit." This is the standard
working edition of the Greek text of the Hippocratic collection, and
is the one now usually cited. The accompanying French translation
is complete. There is a translation into English of some of the
treatises, but it cannot be recommended. A new version of the Greek
text is now in slow course of publication by Teubner of Leipsic.</p></div>

slighting of spirits derived from the air, taken in connection with
Aristotle's exaltation of the vital innate heat, may have had much
weight with Harvey, who, although he used the word "spirits" freely,
insisted that the blood and the spirits are one. But in this matter
the Aristotelian precedent cannot have had the same force for Harvey
that it would have for us, because he believed Aristotle to be the
author of two treatises in which the spirits are expressly treated,
not only as entities, but as entities of great physiological
importance, though their relations with the outer air are neglected
in one of the treatises and quite obscurely dealt with in the
other. (See Harvey: On the Motion, etc., IV, Syd. 29, l. 16-25;
Op. Omn. 31, l. 8-16. Do., VI, Syd. 38, l. 7-12; Op. Omn. 40, l.
2-5.) Indeed, Harvey in one of his references to Aristotle directly
affirmed that the philosopher had believed in "motor spirits" within
the animal body. (See Harvey: On the Motion, etc., XVII, Syd. 81, l.
8-12; Op. Omn. 82, l. 31 to 83, l. 3. Compare [Pseudo-] Aristotle:
On Spirits, 485<i>a</i>, 5-8; and the Latin translation of the same
"by an unknown interpreter," 249<i>b</i>, 13-18.) The two treatises in
question are entitled, respectively, "On the Motion of Animals" and
"On Spirits," and have been attributed to Aristotle and habitually
printed among his works, both before and since the time of Harvey.
Modern criticism, however, has made it clear that neither treatise
is a genuine work of Aristotle. It is especially plain that the
treatise "On Spirits" is by another hand and of another school;
among other reasons, because the author declares the skin to be
supplied with blood by the veins, and with spirits by accompanying
vessels which he calls "arteries." In this treatise the maintenance
of the spirits by respiration is discussed, but left uncertain
(483<i>b</i>, 15-19). It is but fair to the criticism of Harvey's
time to note that, glaringly at variance as the undoubted works
of Aristotle are with the treatise "On Spirits," the latter was
pronounced genuine, in 1839, by so eminent a scholar as É. Littré,
in his "&OElig;uvres d'Hippocrate," etc., Vol. I, 203. Reasons why the
treatises in question are not by Aristotle, are given at length in
the essay in Latin by V. Rose, entitled "De Aristotelis Librorum
Ordine et Auctoritate Commentatio," Berlin, 1854, 162-171, and at
the end of 174.</p></div>

Omn. 34, l. 24 to 35, l. 19. In Galen's book, from which Harvey here
quotes, the quoted passage is preceded by a corrected statement of
the mechanics of the valves of the heart, and a declaration that
their mechanics were unknown to Erasistratus. Then follow these
words:&mdash;
</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"If this be so, O followers of Erasistratus, let us omit all
else and consider only what is in controversy. As to the vena
cava, which conveys blood from the liver into the heart, in
which of two ways are its membranes [i.e. the segments of the
tricuspid valve] inserted: do they extend from the interior [of
the ventricle] outward, or contrariwise, from without inward?
But perhaps this is of no great moment!"</p></blockquote>

<p class="noind">The preceding words are immediately followed by the words
quoted by Harvey. The context shows that the phrase "from without
inward" indicates the true insertion of the "membranes" of the
tricuspid valve, according to both Galen and the facts. Harvey
himself refers his quotation from Galen to the treatise "On the
Doctrines of Hippocrates and Plato, Book VI." It is from chapter 6
of that book. The Latin text quoted by Harvey, and that from which
the quotation in this note has been translated, may be found in
the Ninth Juntine Edition of Galen's works, consisting of Latin
translations by various hands. This edition was published in Venice
in 1625, three years before the publication of Harvey's treatise.
The title of the edition is: Galeni Opera ex Nona Juntarum Editione,
etc. Venetiis, apud Juntas, MDCXXV, Cum privilegiis. The passage
quoted in this note is: "Prima classis," folio 264 D, l. 53-56.
Harvey's quotation is: folio 264 D, l. 56 to folio 264 (verso) E, l.
3. The Greek text of the passage quoted in this note is to be found
in Kn. Vol. V, 550, l. 9-15; Mül. 541, l. 4-9. The Greek text of
Harvey's quotation is in Kn. Vol. V, 550, l. 15 to 551, l. 6; Mül.

<p><a name="Footnote_153_153" id="Footnote_153_153"></a><a href="#FNanchor_153_153"><span class="label">[153]</span></a> Harvey: On the Motion, etc., V, Syd. 32, l. 39 to 34, l. 22;
Op. Omn. 32, l. 24 to 36, l. 15. The second Galenic passage above,
which refers to the origin and contents of the arteries and to the
aortic valves, is printed in italics and with quotation marks in the
first edition of Harvey's treatise, and Harvey's own words regarding
this passage seem to mean that it is a verbal quotation from Galen.
But neither in Galen's treatise entitled "Is Blood Naturally
Contained in the Arteries?" nor in the sixth book of his treatise
On the Doctrines of Hippocrates and Plato, does more than the
last part of this seeming quotation occur. The rest appears to be
merely a sound statement by Harvey of Galenic doctrines, for which
abundant authority can be found in the two treatises aforesaid.
See especially for the origin of the arteries: On the Doctrines of
Hippocrates and Plato, Book VI, chapter 3, Kn. Vol. V, 524, l. 13 to
525, l. 3; Mül. 512, l. 4-13; and for the contents of the arteries:
chapter 4, Kn. Vol. V, 537, l. 1-7; Mül. 526, l. 1-7; and chapter 8,
Kn. Vol. V, 572, l. 12 to 573, l. 11; Mül. 565, l. 10 to 566, l.
12. Of the words relating to the aortic valves, the first part is a
statement justified by the words which occur in the Ninth Juntine
edition of Galen's works, Classis I, folio 264C, l. 41-43 and D,
l. 49-53. But the last part of the passage aforesaid is a verbal
quotation of words on folio 264 verso E, l. 9-11. This passage
relating to the valves is all in Galen's treatise On the Doctrines
of Hippocrates and Plato, Book VI, chapter 6. The Greek text may be
found as follows: Kn. Vol. V, 549, l. 3-8, 549, l. 18 to 550, l. 6,
552, l. 1-3; Mül. 539, l. 10 to 540, l. 1, 540, l. 11 to 541, l. 1,
543, l. 1-3.</p></div>

It was not Greek philosophy alone in which in ancient times the word
corresponding to "soul" was used in a wider sense than that of the
quotation from "Hamlet." In the English Authorized Version of the
Old Testament, first published in 1611, we read in Genesis II, 7:
"Man became a living soul." The reading is the same in the Revised
Version of 1885. In Genesis I, 30, we read in both versions: "And
to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to
every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein <em>there is</em> life,
<em>I have given</em> every green herb for meat." In both versions it is
noted in the margin that the expression translated by the single
English word "life" is, in the Hebrew, "a living soul." Accordingly
we find this Hebrew expression of Genesis I, 30, rendered "a soul
of life"&mdash;ψυχὴν ζωῆς,&mdash;in the ancient translation of
the Old Testament into Greek, known as the "Septuagint," which was
probably completed less than two hundred years after the death of
Aristotle and more than one hundred and fifty years before the
Christian era. In the early Latin translation of the Scriptures
which was finished in <small>A.D.</small> 405, and is largely embodied
in the "Vulgate" of to-day, we read in the same verse&mdash;Genesis I,
30, "<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">anima viviens</i>"&mdash;"a living soul." In Genesis II, 7, where the
reference is to man himself and the English Bible reads "a living
soul," the Vulgate reads "<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">animam viventem</i>," using the same Latin
words as for the lower creatures of I, 30. In like manner the
Septuagint reads in Genesis II, 7, ψυχὴν ζῶσαν, as it
reads in I, 30, ψυχὴν ζωῆς. Other instances from the Book
of Genesis could be cited of the wide significance given therein to
the expression which corresponds to "soul."</p></div>

from his quotation:&mdash;
</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"and, moreover, as the souls differ one from another in nobility
and ignobleness, so too does the nature aforesaid differ."
(Aristotle: On the Generation of Animals, 736<i>b</i>, 31-33.)</p></blockquote>

<p>
If these words be read in their proper connection, it becomes clear
that "the nature which is analogous to the element of the stars"
is the same as "the nature aforesaid" (ἡ τοιαύτη φύσις),
which is the "body other than the so-called elements and more
divine." Fire is repeatedly styled a "body" by Aristotle, it being
one of the four "simple bodies" (ἁπλᾶ σώματα) or elements.
Compare Aristotle: On Generation and Corruption, 330<i>b</i>, 1-3. We
shall find that Harvey in his turn styles fire a "body" (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">corpus</i>).
See Harvey: On Generation, LXXI, Syd. 506, l. 26-31; Op. Omn. 527,
l. 28 to 528, l. 1.
</p>
<p>
The Latin translation of Aristotle which Harvey quotes reads, in
dealing with the "spirits": "<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">spiritus qui in semine spumosoque
corpore continetur, et natura quae in eo spiritu est proportione
respondens elemento stellarum</i>." (Aristotle: On the Generation of
Animals, Vol. III, 360<i>b</i>, 4-5.) The Greek text reads: τὸ ἐμπεριλαμβανόμενον ἐν τῷ σπέρματι καὶ ἐν τῷ ἀφρώδει πνεῦμα καὶ ἐν τῷ
πνεύματι φύσις, ἀνάλογον ὀῦσα τῷ τῶν ἄστρων
στοιχείῳ (736<i>b</i>, 35 to 737<i>a</i>, 1). Two manuscripts omit
"ἐν" before "τῷ πνεύματι."
</p>
<p>
In the chapter immediately preceding Aristotle says:&mdash;
</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Not only does a liquid become thick which is made of water and
earthy matter, but also one made of water and spirits; even as
foam thickens and whitens; and the smaller and less conspicuous
the bubbles are, the whiter and stiffer does the mass appear.
Oil, too, is affected in the same way; for it becomes thick when
mixed with spirits, so that, as it whitens, it thickens; what
is watery within it being separated by the heat, and becoming
spirits.... For the reasons aforesaid the semen, too, is stiff
and white as it issues from within, since it contains much hot
spirits due to the interior heat. But after the exit of the
semen, when its heat has exhaled and its air has cooled, it
liquefies and darkens. For in drying semen, as in phlegm, the
water remains and perhaps some little earthy matter. The semen
then is a combination of spirits and water, the spirits being
hot air; so the semen, being derived from water, is naturally
liquid.... The cause of the whiteness of the semen is that the
generative medium (ἡ γονή) is foam, and that foam is
white.... It seems not to have escaped even the ancients that
the nature of semen is foamy; at all events they named from this
property (δυνάμεως) the goddess who rules coition."
(Aristotle: On the Generation of Animals, 735<i>b</i>, 8-16; 735<i>b</i>,
32 to 736<i>a</i>, 2; 736<i>a</i>, 13-14 and <i>a</i>, 18-21.)</p></blockquote>

<p>
A very ancient poem, ascribed to Hesiod, relates the myth of
Aphrodite and says that she was so called by gods and men "because
she was produced in foam." (Theogony, l. 197-198.) The "air"
ἀήρ of one of the foregoing passages from Aristotle is of
course not atmospheric air, but something aëriform produced by
heat, as the context shows. In the same treatise he speaks of the
presence, within the early embryo which has never breathed, of
spirits (πνεῦμα) due to heat and moisture, "the one active, the
other passive." (On the Generation of Animals, 741<i>b</i>, 37 to 742<i>a</i>,
16.)</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_321_321" id="Footnote_321_321"></a><a href="#FNanchor_321_321"><span class="label">[321]</span></a> The Latin translation quoted by Harvey renders the Greek words
"ὀυδὲ φαίνεται συνιστάμενον πυρουμένοις ὀύτ' [ἐν]
ὑγροῖς ὀύτ ἐν ξηροῖς ὀυθέν"
(737a, 1-3) by the misleading words "<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">neque constitui quidquam densis
vel humidis vel siccis videntur</i>." Therefore, in translating this passage
into English, it has seemed necessary to make it intelligible
by giving to the word "πυρουμένοις" its proper meaning, rather than
by rendering literally the earlier translator's ill-chosen Latin word
"<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">densis</i>."</p></div>

7. In translating into English the foregoing Aristotelian passages
the present writer has sought rather to indicate than to smooth away
the ruggedness of the original Greek. Harvey quotes these passages
verbatim from a Latin translation which may be found in Volume III
of the Berlin Academy's quarto edition of Aristotle's works. This
translation was made in the fifteenth century by Theodore Gaza, a
learned Greek of Thessalonica, who had fled from the conquering
Turks to Italy, where he learned Latin not long before his thirtieth
year. Gaza was neither physician nor biologist. In view of these
facts we need not wonder that his Latin version of Aristotle On the
Generation of Animals is occasionally unsatisfactory, as we have
seen. In the edition of the Greek text of Aristotle's History of
Animals, published by Teubner in 1907 (Aristotelis De Animalibus
Historia, textum recognovit Leonardus Dittmeyer, 1907, Leipsic,
p. XXII, l. 1-5), the editor says in his Latin preface, regarding
Gaza's Latin Translation of the History of Animals: "There is
need of caution, if we wish to unearth the Greek text from his
interpretation."</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_405_405" id="Footnote_405_405"></a><a href="#FNanchor_405_405"><span class="label">[405]</span></a> Strictly speaking, it is left uncertain by the Greek text
whether the verb translated by the words "when ... inclusion ...
has taken place" refers to "heat," or to "soul," or to both. This
uncertainty, however, does not affect the sense, as both the
expression "psychical heat," and the words which follow it, imply
the association of heat and soul with one another. A line or two
beyond this quoted passage, Aristotle speaks of "the inclusion of
the psychical principle."</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_406_406" id="Footnote_406_406"></a><a href="#FNanchor_406_406"><span class="label">[406]</span></a> Owing to the vagueness of the word συνιστάται this
must be translated here by a periphrasis such as "an individual
is formed." The verb συνιστάναι is used by Aristotle to
express not only the immediate result of spontaneous generation,
or the production of the embryo in sexual generation, but also the
curdling of milk, the condensation of vapor into water, and even the
constitution of the universe.</p></div>
